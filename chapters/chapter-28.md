# Chapter 28: Wayne's Fate

Jessie Carter stood in Wayne Keller's abandoned trailer on a cold November afternoon, trying to understand what had happened to the man who'd helped them break the case.

The trailer park manager had called her that morning. "Wayne's rent is paid through December, but nobody's seen him since September. Thought you might know where he went."

She didn't.

Nobody did.

The trailer was empty—not ransacked, not disturbed. Just... empty. No furniture, no clothes, no personal belongings. The refrigerator door hung open, unplugged. The bathroom cabinet stood bare. Even the trash cans were empty.

Wayne Keller had vanished deliberately, methodically, completely.

Jessie walked through the small space, looking for something—a note, a clue, any indication of where he'd gone or why. She found nothing. Wayne had erased himself from Ashfield as thoroughly as if he'd never existed.

The only evidence he'd been here at all was the stack of letters on the kitchen counter. Three sealed envelopes she'd found the morning after his testimony. One to Detective Hendricks. One to Lisa Hendricks' mother. One to Jessie herself.

She'd read hers a dozen times. *I can't be part of that. I have to go.*

Simple. Final. Gone.

That was three months ago. September, right after Wayne gave his testimony to state police. Six hours of recorded confession about helping Eugene dispose of Lisa's body in 1975. The testimony that broke Vernon's legal defense, established the family pattern, made conviction inevitable.

And then Wayne had disappeared.

Detective Sarah Hendricks sat across from Jessie at Preston's Café, a folder open between them. December gray filtered through windows. The café was quiet—mid-afternoon lull, only a few customers.

"We found his truck," Hendricks said. "Casper, Wyoming. Truck stop off I-25. Abandoned three weeks ago, keys in the ignition."

Jessie's stomach tightened. "Signs of struggle?"

"None. No blood, no damage, nothing suspicious. Forensics found Wayne's fingerprints, some fast-food wrappers, a receipt from a Western Union office in Cheyenne dated mid-September. That's it."

"Where did he go after Wyoming?"

"Unknown. Trail goes cold in Casper. He either got a ride, took a bus, or bought another vehicle under a different name. We've checked bus terminals, car dealerships, rental agencies within a hundred miles. Nothing."

Jessie looked at the photo Hendricks had provided. Wayne's truck, dusty and alone in a truck stop parking lot. Ordinary. Unremarkable. Like Wayne had just walked away and never looked back.

"Do you think he's alive?" Jessie asked.

Hendricks closed the folder. "I think Wayne Keller deliberately disappeared. Left his truck where it would be found, made sure it looked clean—no evidence of foul play, no reason to suspect murder. If someone wanted him dead, they wouldn't leave the truck intact in a public place. They'd hide the body, destroy evidence."

"So he's running."

"Probably. From prosecution, from guilt, from Ashfield. Take your pick."

"But he had immunity. The deal was solid."

"Immunity from legal consequences. Not from moral ones." Hendricks leaned back. "Wayne helped bury a murdered girl when he was seventeen. Kept silent for eight years. Drank himself half to death trying to forget. His testimony put Vernon away, but it didn't erase what he'd done. Maybe he couldn't live with that."

Jessie thought about Wayne's face when she'd last seen him—hollow, exhausted, relieved and destroyed all at once. He'd done the right thing. Given testimony that ensured justice for seventeen women. And then he'd vanished.

"You think he's starting over somewhere," Jessie said.

"I think he's trying to."

"Under a different name?"

"Probably. New identity, new life, somewhere nobody knows what he did." Hendricks paused. "His ex-wife in Omaha reported receiving a money order two months ago. Three thousand dollars, no return address, postmark too blurred to read. She thinks it was child support—Wayne trying to make amends for being a deadbeat father."

"Does that mean he's okay?"

"It means he was alive in October. After that?" Hendricks shrugged. "We have no leads, no sightings, no paper trail. Wayne Keller effectively doesn't exist anymore."

Jessie absorbed this. Wayne had helped them, testified, then disappeared. Redemption or escape? Justice or cowardice?

Maybe both.

"Are you still investigating?" Jessie asked.

"Officially? No. Wayne's not a suspect, not a fugitive. He fulfilled his immunity agreement—gave testimony, cooperated fully. What he does after that is his business." Hendricks stood, gathering her folder. "Unofficially? I hope he found whatever he was looking for. He broke the case. Without his testimony about 1975, Vernon's lawyers could've argued Eugene acted alone, that Vernon was just preserving evidence. Wayne's confession established the pattern, proved family knowledge, sealed the conviction."

"So we owe him."

"We owe him acknowledgment that he did the right thing when it mattered. The rest is his to figure out."

Hendricks left. Jessie sat alone with cold coffee, thinking about Wayne Keller. Friction character. Catalyst. The man whose guilt and testimony had exposed a century of murder.

And now, a ghost.

That evening, the group met at Tammy's salon. The four of them—Jessie, Tammy, Aaron, Holly. The vacant chair where Wayne used to sit felt obvious.

"Hendricks says the investigation is closed," Jessie reported. "Wayne deliberately disappeared. No evidence of foul play. Truck found in Wyoming, trail cold after that."

"You think he's alive?" Tammy asked.

"His ex-wife got child support money. Suggests he is."

Aaron leaned against the counter. "Or someone wants us to think he is. Vernon had connections. Even in custody, the Crowley family had resources. Wayne was a loose end."

"Vernon was in jail when Wayne disappeared," Jessie countered. "Under surveillance, no contact with outside except lawyers."

"Family has money. Hiring someone to silence a witness isn't complicated."

Tammy shook her head. "You really think they'd kill Wayne after he'd already testified? The damage was done. His recorded testimony was admitted into evidence. Killing him wouldn't change that."

"It would send a message. Don't testify against the Crowleys."

"Except the Crowleys are finished. Vernon's in prison for life. Eugene's dead. The family name is erased. Who's left to send messages?"

Silence settled over the salon.

Holly spoke quietly. "I think he's alive somewhere. Starting over."

"Based on what?" Aaron asked. Not unkind, just factual.

"Faith. Hope. The singing." Holly looked at them. "The voices have been quieter since the trial. Like they're satisfied. If Wayne had been murdered, if he'd been silenced violently, I think I'd hear it. I think they'd tell me."

"Supernatural testimony isn't evidence," Aaron said gently.

"I know. But I believe he's okay. Somewhere far from here, trying to be better than he was."

Tammy touched Holly's shoulder. "I hope you're right, kid."

Jessie looked around the salon—these people who'd risked everything to expose the truth. They'd all lost something. Tammy had been vandalized and threatened. Aaron had received death threats. Holly had been harassed at school. Jessie's family farm still struggled financially after Crowley economic control collapsed.

And Wayne had lost himself. Vanished into a self-imposed exile, carrying guilt that testimony and immunity couldn't erase.

"What do you think happened to him?" Tammy asked Jessie.

Jessie considered. "I think Wayne Keller couldn't forgive himself. Legally, he was cleared. Morally, he felt complicit. So he left. Found somewhere new, became someone else. Maybe he's working construction in Montana. Maybe he's bartending in Oregon. Maybe he sends anonymous money to his kid and visits Lisa Hendricks' grave in spirit if not in person."

"That's a lot of maybes," Aaron said.

"That's all we have. Wayne earned his chance to disappear. His testimony put Vernon away. Whatever he's doing now, wherever he is, he earned the right to try again."

"Even if trying again means running from consequences?"

"He didn't run from consequences. He faced them—testified, confessed, gave us everything we needed. Then he ran from the weight of carrying them. I can't blame him for that."

Aaron nodded slowly. "You're more forgiving than I am."

"Or maybe I just understand that some people break under guilt. Wayne broke. But before he did, he helped us. That counts for something."

Tammy lit a cigarette. "You think we'll ever hear from him?"

"No," Jessie said. "I think Wayne Keller is gone for good. And I think that's okay. He did what needed doing. The rest is his business."

Jessie drove home through December darkness, thinking about Wayne's empty trailer. The deliberate erasure. The careful planning it took to disappear completely.

Wayne had been a contradiction from the start—guilty and cooperative, ashamed and helpful, broken but functional. He'd carried the weight of Lisa Hendricks' murder for eight years, drinking to forget what he couldn't change.

And when Aaron had confronted him, Wayne had made a choice. Confess. Testify. Help expose the Crowley dynasty even if it meant admitting his own complicity.

That choice mattered. It had broken the case, established the pattern, made Vernon's conviction inevitable. Without Wayne's testimony about 1975, prosecutors would've struggled to connect Vernon to earlier murders. Wayne had provided the link—eyewitness account of Eugene's method, Vernon's knowledge, family participation.

He'd done the right thing.

And then he'd vanished.

Jessie understood. Some weights couldn't be carried. Wayne had helped bury a murdered girl at seventeen. Testified about it at twenty-five. In between: eight years of guilt, alcohol, self-destruction. Immunity didn't erase that. Testimony didn't absolve it.

So Wayne had left. Started over. Tried to build a life where nobody knew what he'd done, where he could be someone other than the man who'd helped dispose of Lisa Hendricks' body.

Was that redemption? Or escape?

Maybe there wasn't a difference.

Jessie pulled into the farm driveway. The house was warm, lit from within. Her father was inside, reading the newspaper, living the quiet life he'd always wanted.

The Crowley money that had paid for her mother's cancer treatment still haunted her. Blood money. Hush money. The price of silence.

Her father hadn't known. Jessie chose to believe that. But even if he'd suspected, what could he have done? Let his wife die to avoid moral compromise?

Some choices had no good options.

Wayne had faced one of those choices at seventeen—help Eugene or watch his family's business destroyed. He'd chosen survival. Then spent eight years hating himself for it.

Maybe running was the only way he could live with what he'd done.

Jessie hoped he found peace somewhere. Hoped he was alive, healthy, building something better in Montana or Oregon or wherever ghosts went to start over.

She'd never know.

And that was okay.

Some questions didn't need answers. Some people deserved to disappear.

Wayne Keller had earned his mystery.
