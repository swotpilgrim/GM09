# Chapter 10: The Crowley Estate

The Crowley mansion sat on a low rise two miles outside Ashfield, white Victorian architecture with wraparound porches and black shutters. The kind of house that looked like it belonged on a Christmas card—gracious, well-maintained, surrounded by ancient oak trees and perfectly mowed lawns.

Jessie pulled her truck up the circular driveway Saturday afternoon, trying to keep her hands steady on the wheel.

She'd been here dozens of times. Delivering paperwork, attending the Crowleys' Christmas party, drinking punch in the front parlor.

Now the house looked different. Menacing. Built on money from controlling a town, enabling a hundred years of murder.

Vernon was waiting on the front porch. He waved as she parked, and Jessie forced herself to wave back, to smile like everything was normal.

"Jessie! Good to see you." Vernon came down the steps, hand extended. Fifty-four, tall and solid, graying brown hair, distinguished. Khakis and a polo shirt—weekend casual.

She shook his hand. His grip was firm, held a second too long.

"Thanks for making time, Mayor. I know you're busy with the council meeting today."

"That's at three. Plenty of time." He gestured toward the barn, a massive red structure about fifty yards from the house. "Let's take a look at the space. I assume you need to confirm dimensions for the livestock trailers?"

"Right. Equipment storage too." Jessie fell into step beside him, aware of how isolated they were. Nearest neighbor a mile away. If something went wrong—

Stop it. Vernon doesn't suspect anything.

"Terrible business at the fairgrounds," Vernon said conversationally. "State forensics making a mess of everything. Sheriff Pritchard says they should wrap up soon, but who knows? Government people operate on their own timeline."

"Yeah, it's been chaotic."

"Those remains they found—such a mystery. Pritchard thinks they're from the pioneer days, some forgotten cemetery. I've asked the historical society to research it." Vernon's voice was casual, but Jessie felt him watching her. "You were there when they found the first one, weren't you?"

"I was. Pretty shocking."

"I imagine. Must have been quite disturbing for you." His hand touched her back, just briefly, as they walked. "You're handling it well, though. You're a strong woman, Jessie. Your mother would be proud."

The mention of her mother—who'd worked the fair for years, who'd coordinated pageants, who'd trusted the Crowleys—made Jessie's stomach turn. But she kept her face neutral.

"Thanks. Here for the barn."

The barn was massive. Three stories, hayloft, multiple stalls. Smell of old hay, machine oil, wood.

Vernon unlocked the doors, pushed them open. Sunlight streamed in, illuminating dust and equipment.

"Storage in the back," he said. "Old horse stalls on the main floor. Loft has hay bales, feed. Use whatever space you need."

"Perfect. I just need to measure a few things, take some notes. Won't take long."

Vernon checked his watch. "I should head to town for that meeting. You have my number if you need anything. Just lock up when you're done—lock's on the inside of the doors."

"Will do. Thanks, Mayor."

He smiled. For just a second, something in his expression made her skin crawl—assessment, evaluation. Then it passed, and he was just Vernon Crowley again.

"See you at the next planning meeting, Jessie."

She watched him walk back to the house, get in his Lincoln, drive down the driveway and onto the road toward town. When the sound of his engine faded completely, she let out the breath she'd been holding.

Alone. She was alone in the barn.

Jessie pulled Aaron's camera from her jacket pocket—a Kodak 110, simple and reliable. She checked the flash, made sure she had film. Then she started searching.

The main floor was exactly as Vernon had described. Horse stalls that hadn't been used in years, cobwebs in the corners, ancient leather tack hanging on the walls. Farm equipment—a harrow, some old plows, a tractor that looked like it dated from the fifties.

Nothing suspicious. Nothing unusual.

The loft was hay bales and dust. She climbed the ladder carefully, looked around. More equipment, some furniture covered with tarps. A workbench with normal tools—hammers, saws, cans of nails.

She was starting to think Wayne had been wrong, that there was nothing here to find, when she noticed the door.

Back corner of the main floor, half-hidden behind a stack of feed bags. A regular door, painted the same red as the barn walls, with a padlock.

Locked room. Why would you lock a room in a barn?

Jessie approached slowly. The padlock was new, brass and solid. She pulled at it experimentally—no give.

She went back to the workbench, found a crowbar and a hammer. Returned to the locked door.

If she broke the lock, Vernon would know someone had been here. Would know someone had searched the barn.

But she'd come this far. And whatever was behind that door was worth protecting with a new padlock.

Jessie wedged the crowbar under the hasp, brought the hammer down hard. The wood splintered. Two more hits and the hasp tore free, screws and all.

The door swung open.

It took a moment for her eyes to adjust. The room was dark, windowless. She found a light switch on the wall inside, flipped it. A single bulb illuminated the space.

Workshop. Maybe ten by ten feet. Another workbench along one wall, more tools. Coiled ropes on hooks. And the floor—

Dark stains on the concrete. Multiple stains, concentrated near the center drain.

Blood. Old blood.

Jessie's heart hammered. She raised the camera, started photographing. The room, the workbench, the ropes, the stains. Evidence.

Then she saw the trunk.

Beneath the workbench, pushed back against the wall. Old-fashioned, heavy wood with metal reinforcing. No lock on this one—just a simple latch.

Her hands were shaking as she pulled it out, opened it.

Seventeen sashes.

White silk with gold lettering, each carefully folded and labeled. Strips of masking tape with dates and names written in neat script:

*Lorraine Fisher, 1952*

*Mary Petersen, 1961*

*Lisa Hendricks, 1975*

They were all there. Every missing queen from Aaron's timeline. All seventeen.

But the sashes weren't the only things in the trunk.

Jewelry—class rings, bracelets, necklaces. Small envelopes labeled with dates, each containing a lock of hair. Photographs—girls smiling at the camera, some in their pageant dresses, some in casual clothes. Some photos showed girls who looked frightened, who weren't smiling.

Trophies. These were trophies.

Vernon Crowley had killed seventeen women and kept souvenirs of each one. Proof of his power, his control. Evidence of a century of murder stored in a trunk like someone else might store old photo albums.

Jessie photographed everything. Each sash, each piece of jewelry, each photograph. Her hands were shaking so badly that some of the pictures came out blurred, but she kept going, methodical, making sure every piece of evidence was documented.

She was photographing the last envelope—*Karen Matthews, 1981*—when she heard the vehicle.

Engine. Close. Coming up the driveway.

Vernon. He was back.

Panic flooded through her. Jessie stuffed everything back into the trunk, closed it, shoved it under the workbench. Grabbed the camera, turned off the light, pulled the broken door mostly closed—it wouldn't lock, but from a distance maybe it would look intact.

She walked quickly toward the main barn doors, trying to compose herself. Trying to look like someone who'd just been measuring storage space, not someone who'd just found evidence of serial murder.

Vernon's Lincoln pulled up outside. She heard the car door slam, his footsteps approaching.

"Jessie? You still here?"

"Just finishing up!" Her voice sounded too high, too strained. She cleared her throat. "Got all the measurements I needed."

Vernon appeared in the doorway, backlit by afternoon sun. She couldn't see his expression clearly.

"Finished your meeting already?" she asked, trying for casual conversation.

"Started early, ended early. Quorum issues." He stepped into the barn, looking around. Looking at her. "Find everything okay?"

"Yep. Plenty of space for what we need."

He walked past her, slowly, looking at the barn interior. His eyes tracked to the back corner where the locked room was. Jessie's heart stopped.

Could he tell? Could he see from here that the lock was broken?

"Good, good," Vernon said after a moment. "We want this centennial fair to be special. Memorable. A real celebration of Ashfield's history."

"It will be."

He turned to face her. "You seem nervous, Jessie. Everything alright?"

"Fine. Just tired. Long week."

"Yes, it has been." He smiled. "Those bodies at the fairgrounds have everyone on edge. People asking questions, getting ideas. The sheriff says some folks have been researching old records, digging into history that's better left alone."

The threat was clear. He knew someone was investigating.

"People are curious," Jessie said carefully. "It's natural."

"Curiosity can be dangerous. Especially in a small town where everyone knows everyone." Vernon's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Your family has deep roots in Ashfield, Jessie. Your father, your mother—good people who understood how this town works. I'd hate to see anything jeopardize your family's standing here."

There it was. The explicit threat. Back off or lose everything.

"I understand," Jessie said.

"Good." The smile warmed slightly. "I knew you would. The Carters have always been sensible. Now, I should let you get back to your farm. Lots to do before the fair."

He walked her to her truck, chatted about livestock schedules and planning meetings like they hadn't just had a conversation full of unspoken menace. Jessie got in, started the engine, drove down the driveway at a normal speed even though everything in her wanted to floor the accelerator.

In her rearview mirror, she saw Vernon standing in front of his mansion, watching her go.

The camera in her jacket pocket felt like it was burning through the fabric. Evidence. Undeniable proof of seventeen murders.

But if Vernon suspected she'd found it, if he checked the barn and saw the broken lock—

She'd just made herself a target.

Jessie drove back to town, hands gripping the wheel, knowing that everything had just changed.

They had the proof they needed. But now the killer knew someone was onto him.

The countdown had begun.
