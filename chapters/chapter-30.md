# Chapter 30: The Singing

Holly Brennan stood at the entrance to the Eldon County Fairgrounds on a warm September evening, wearing a simple white dress, no crown, no sash. Just white cotton, modest and respectful.

The fair was reopening. One year after the discoveries. One year after seventeen women were finally acknowledged.

The crowd was smaller than past years—maybe two hundred people instead of a thousand. Some families couldn't return. The associations were too painful, the memories too raw. But most of Ashfield had shown up. Farmers with livestock. Vendors with food stalls. Children running between exhibits, laughing.

Different. Quieter. But alive.

Holly walked through the gates, past the new sign: *Eldon County Fair - Reclaiming Our Heritage, Honoring the Lost.*

The memorial garden stood where the old main stage had been. Circular, peaceful, beautiful. Seventeen wooden benches arranged around a central fountain. Native Iowa prairie flowers blooming everywhere—black-eyed Susans golden in evening light, purple coneflowers swaying in the breeze, wild bergamot fragrant and bright.

Each bench bore a carved name, dates, a brief inscription chosen by families.

*Ruth Ann Brennan, 1943-1961. "She wanted to teach the world."*

*Lisa Marie Hendricks, 1957-1975. "She loved animals and made terrible jokes."*

*Catherine Mills, 1961-1979. "She dreamed of college and freedom."*

Seventeen benches. Seventeen names. Seventeen lives honored not as victims or scandals, but as people who'd mattered.

The central fountain flowed continuously, water gentle over Iowa limestone. All seventeen names were engraved in the stone, permanent and visible. Holly touched Ruth's name as she passed, fingers tracing the carved letters.

"Hi, Aunt Ruth," she whispered. "We did it. We remembered you right."

---

The opening ceremony began at seven PM. Mayor Harrison welcomed everyone, acknowledged the difficult year, praised the community for choosing transformation over denial.

Then Holly stepped to the podium.

Public speaking still made her nervous—she was eighteen now, graduated from high school, planning to attend Iowa State for social work. But she'd learned that important things required courage, not comfort.

"I'm Holly Brennan," she began. "Seventeen Memorial Tribute representative, chosen for community service and victim advocacy. I'm honored to speak tonight."

The crowd listened quietly. Respectful, attentive.

"A year ago, we discovered that seventeen women had been murdered and buried at these fairgrounds. That discovery destroyed illusions, exposed corruption, forced us to confront ugly truths about our community's history. It was painful. It still is."

Holly looked at the memorial garden. "But we made a choice. We chose to remember instead of forget. To acknowledge instead of deny. To transform what was a hunting ground into a place of honor and education. That choice matters."

She pulled out her prepared remarks but set them aside. This needed to come from the heart.

"The seventeen women we're honoring tonight were real people. Ruth Brennan was my great-aunt. She wanted to be a teacher. She loved horses and literature and had her whole life ahead of her. She was murdered at eighteen because she said no to a powerful man who believed he owned her."

Emotion tightened her voice. "Ruth deserved better. They all did. And while we can't bring them back, we can make sure their deaths weren't meaningless. We can learn from what happened. Teach future generations about power, accountability, the importance of believing victims. We can build systems that protect vulnerable people instead of enabling violence."

She gestured to the domestic violence shelter banner. "The Seventeen Memorial Center offers resources for abuse survivors. Fair proceeds fund it. Every person who visits tonight contributes to that. Every vendor booth, every livestock entry, every dollar spent here helps protect future women."

Holly smiled softly. "That's the transformation. From hunting ground to memorial. From silence to acknowledgment. From complicity to accountability. The fair continues—not despite the horror, but because of it. We're reclaiming what was stolen and using it to build something better."

She stepped down to applause. Not jubilant—too somber for that. But genuine, warm, supportive.

Jessie caught her eye from the livestock barn, nodded approval. Aaron stood near the memorial garden, camera ready to document the reopening. Tammy manned a booth for the domestic violence shelter, collecting donations and distributing information.

The group that had exposed the truth, scattered now through the fairgrounds, each contributing to the transformation they'd fought for.

---

The fair ran until ten PM. Lower attendance than past years, but present, engaged, respectful. People visited the memorial garden, left flowers, read the inscriptions. Children asked questions—parents explained carefully, honestly, age-appropriately.

Educational exhibits drew steady crowds. Displays about domestic violence prevention, community accountability, the history of the crimes. Not sensational. Just truthful.

Holly worked the Seventeen Memorial booth, answering questions, sharing information about the shelter, accepting donations. By closing time, they'd raised over a thousand dollars. Small but significant.

As vendors packed up and families headed home, the fairgrounds emptied. Security lights illuminated the paths. September stars emerged overhead, clear and bright.

Holly found Jessie near the livestock barn, finishing final checks on the cattle exhibits. Familiar, grounding work—Jessie had been coordinating livestock shows for twenty years. The fair felt more normal when she was checking water buckets and feed supplies.

"How'd we do?" Jessie asked.

"Good. Lower attendance, but people were respectful. The memorial garden had visitors all night."

"That's what matters."

They walked together through the fairgrounds, quiet and companionable. Past the Ferris wheel (still operational, though rides had been subdued). Past the food vendors (packing up funnel cake machines and corn dog fryers). Past the educational exhibits (carefully curated, professionally presented).

And then to the memorial garden.

The fountain glowed under landscape lighting, water flowing gently. The seventeen benches sat in a circle, names visible in the soft illumination. Prairie flowers swayed in evening breeze, fragrant and alive.

Holly and Jessie stood at the garden's edge, silent.

Then Holly heard it.

Singing.

Multiple voices, female, harmonizing softly. The melody was familiar—"The Iowa Corn Song," the old fair pageant anthem. But gentler now. Not performative or showy. Just... peaceful.

*"We're from Iowa, Iowa,*
*State of all the land.*
*Joy on every hand.*
*We're from Iowa, Iowa,*
*That's where the tall corn grows."*

Holly smiled. She'd been hearing the singing for over a year—seventeen voices, sorrowful and insistent, demanding acknowledgment. But this was different. Peaceful. Accepting.

Like they were satisfied. Like the memorial had given them what they needed.

"Do you hear that?" Holly whispered.

Jessie was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Yes."

Holly looked at her, surprised. Jessie had always been skeptical, dismissing the singing as stress or imagination.

"You hear them?"

"I hear something," Jessie said carefully. "Singing. Harmonies. Can't tell if it's real or if I just... want it to be real."

They stood listening. The voices continued, soft and gentle. Not haunting. Welcoming.

*"We're from Iowa, Iowa,*
*That's where the tall corn grows."*

The singing held for another minute, then faded gradually. Wind through prairie grass, water flowing over limestone, the distant sounds of the town settling for the night.

Holly felt peace settle over her. The voices had been demanding acknowledgment, belief, remembrance. Now they had it. The memorial garden, the transformed fair, the community choosing truth over comfort.

Maybe that was enough.

"Were they really here?" Jessie asked quietly.

Holly considered. "I don't know. Maybe they were. Maybe it was just the wind and our hope and the need to believe they're at peace. Does it matter?"

"Does it?"

"I think... the memorial is real. The acknowledgment is real. The seventeen women are remembered now. Whether their spirits were actually singing or whether we just needed to hear it..." Holly shrugged. "Either way, we honored them right."

Jessie nodded. Her weathered farmer's hands touched Ruth Brennan's bench, fingers tracing the carved inscription. *"She wanted to teach the world."*

"I'm glad you hear it too," Holly said. "Even if we don't know what it means."

"Me too, kid."

They left the memorial garden quietly, walking through the empty fairgrounds. Security lights cast long shadows. Stars overhead were brilliant, unpolluted by city lights. September in Iowa—harvest season, new beginnings, the cycle continuing.

Behind them, the seventeen benches sat in their circle. Names visible in the moonlight. Prairie flowers growing wild and free around them.

Justice had been incomplete. Vernon was in prison, but Eugene had escaped trial. Wayne had vanished. Some families still defended the Crowleys. Some townspeople still chose denial over acknowledgment.

But seventeen women were remembered now. Named, honored, believed. The systems that had enabled their murders were exposed and dismantled. The community had chosen difficult truth over comfortable lies.

That wasn't perfect justice. But it was something.

Holly and Jessie reached the fairgrounds gate. Turned back for one final look.

The memorial garden glowed softly in the night. Peaceful, beautiful, permanent. A place where people could come to remember, to grieve, to learn. A space transformed from horror to hope.

"Think they're at peace now?" Jessie asked.

Holly listened to the night. No singing. Just wind, water, stars.

"I hope so," she said.

They walked to Jessie's truck. Drove home through dark country roads, fields harvested and quiet. The fair would run all weekend—smaller, different, transformed. But present. Alive.

Ashfield had made its choice. To remember the seventeen women. To acknowledge what had been done to them. To build something better from the ruins of a corrupted legacy.

Whether that was enough to bring peace to the dead, Holly couldn't say.

But it was a start.

And sometimes, a start was all you could ask for.

*Dedicated to the seventeen women who refused.*

*May their names be remembered.*

*May their stories be told.*

*May justice, incomplete but real, honor their lives.*
