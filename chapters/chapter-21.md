# Chapter 21: State Police Arrival

Aaron Webb watched Detective Sarah Hendricks take command of the Eldon County Fairgrounds with the efficiency of someone who'd been preparing for eight years.

Mid-thirties, blonde hair pulled back, DCI windbreaker. Professional, controlled. But Aaron saw the tension in her jaw when she looked at the excavation marked "Hendricks, L. 1975."

Her sister. Lisa. Eighteen years old when she disappeared. The reason Sarah had joined state police, specialized in cold cases.

Now she had evidence.

"Secure the perimeter," Hendricks ordered troopers. "No one enters these excavation sites. This is now an active state-level crime scene."

She turned to Paulson, the foreman who'd abandoned his bulldozers. "Your name and company. You'll provide a statement about who hired you."

Paulson nodded, relieved.

Hendricks scanned the crowd—fifty townspeople, divided. "Everyone who's not a witness or victim's family clears out. This is a criminal investigation."

People began dispersing. Some reluctantly, others quickly.

Vernon Crowley stood beside his Cadillac, flanked by the state trooper who'd read him his rights. He hadn't been handcuffed yet—lawyers and procedure demanded certain formalities—but everyone understood his situation.

Hendricks approached him with folder in hand. "Mr. Mayor. I have search warrants for the Eldon County Fairgrounds and your family estate at 1847 North County Road. Authorized by Judge Martinez, Polk County. Do you understand?"

"I want my attorney present," Vernon said.

"That's your right. But the search proceeds with or without him." Hendricks handed him copies of the warrants. "We'll be examining the Crowley barn specifically, based on evidence provided by witnesses regarding items stored there related to this investigation."

Vernon's composure cracked slightly. "What witnesses?"

"That's part of the ongoing investigation." Hendricks gestured to Aaron. "Mr. Webb, you had evidence to present?"

Aaron stepped forward with his briefcase, pulling out folders. "Structural analysis of burial sites showing construction timelines. Financial records documenting payments to victim families. Witness testimony from Wayne Keller regarding the 1975 homicide. Documentation of tonight's attempted destruction of evidence."

He handed everything to Hendricks. She flipped through quickly, professional mask betraying nothing. But her hands tightened on the folders when she reached Wayne's statement about Lisa.

"This is substantial," she said quietly. "Mr. Crowley, based on preliminary evidence, you're being detained for questioning regarding seventeen potential homicides spanning 1884 to 1981. You're not under arrest at this time, but I strongly advise cooperation."

"I've done nothing wrong," Vernon said. The politician mask was back, righteous indignation. "My family has served this community for a hundred years. These accusations are baseless slander from people who want to destroy Ashfield's reputation."

"Then you'll welcome the opportunity to clear your name." Hendricks nodded to the trooper. "Take him to the county sheriff's station. Secure interview room. No contact with local law enforcement."

As Vernon was led away, Hendricks turned to Sheriff Pritchard, who'd been standing silently to the side.

"Sheriff, I need your department's files on every missing person case in Eldon County for the past fifty years."

Pritchard shifted uncomfortably. "Some of those weren't officially missing persons. Just... people who left town."

"I want them anyway. Every case. On my desk by noon tomorrow."

"Yes, ma'am."

"And Sheriff?" Hendricks' voice went cold. "I'll be reviewing your department's conduct during this investigation. If I find evidence of obstruction, corruption, or failure to investigate, we'll have a different conversation. Understood?"

Pritchard went pale. "Understood."

Hendricks assembled her team—six investigators, two forensic technicians, a photographer. "We're executing search warrants at the Crowley estate. Fairgrounds remain secured. Crime scene team documents every burial site before any remains are disturbed. I want photographs, measurements, soil samples, everything."

She looked at Aaron. "You mapped the structural patterns?"

"Yes. Each burial corresponds to a fairgrounds construction project. I have documentation going back to 1884."

"I'll need that. And I'll need you to walk my team through your findings."

"Of course."

Hendricks turned to Jessie. "Ms. Carter. You found the... items in the Crowley barn?"

Jessie nodded. "Trophy trunk. Seventeen sashes from fair queens, labeled with names and dates. Physical evidence linking Vernon to every victim."

"Can you guide my team to the exact location?"

"Yes."

"Good." Hendricks checked her watch. Eleven-fifteen PM. "Let's move. I want that barn searched and secured before Mr. Crowley's lawyers arrive."

---

The Crowley estate sat two miles north of Ashfield, two hundred acres of prime farmland surrounding a Victorian mansion built in 1889. Aaron had researched the property—originally Thomas Crowley's homestead, passed down through three generations, financed by the bank the family owned.

The barn stood three hundred yards from the main house. Large, old, originally built for livestock but converted to storage decades ago.

State police vehicles surrounded both structures. Work lights illuminated the property like daylight. Investigators moved with practiced efficiency.

Jessie led Hendricks and two technicians into the barn. Aaron followed, camera ready.

The trunk sat where Jessie had found it—northwest corner, partially hidden under farm equipment. Oak wood, brass fittings, locked with a padlock.

"Bolt cutters," Hendricks ordered.

A technician cut the lock. The trunk opened.

Seventeen silk sashes, folded carefully, each labeled with a paper tag. Names and dates in neat handwriting:

*Thomas Crowley's hand for the older ones. Eugene's for mid-century. Vernon's for the recent victims.*

Hendricks pulled on latex gloves, lifting the first sash with forceps. "Mary Blackwell, 1884 Fair Queen." She photographed it, documented it, placed it in an evidence bag.

One by one, she processed them. Ruth Brennan. Lisa Hendricks. Catherine Mills. Lorraine Fisher. Patricia Howell. Fourteen others, each with a name, a date, a story.

When she reached Lisa's sash—1975, lilac-colored silk, slightly faded—Hendricks' hands paused. Just for a moment. Then she continued documenting, professional and thorough.

Vernon Crowley arrived with his lawyer twenty minutes into the search. Richard Thornton from Des Moines, expensive suit, briefcase full of objections.

"This search is premature and overly broad," Thornton announced. "My client has not been charged with any crime."

"Your client is being detained for questioning," Hendricks said, not looking up from photographing the trophies. "These warrants are valid and specific. You're welcome to observe, but don't interfere."

Vernon stood in the barn doorway, watching his collection being documented and bagged. His face had gone white.

"I never knew those were there," he said. "My father must have—those must be my father's. Eugene. He had... collections. Old fair memorabilia."

"Memorabilia," Hendricks repeated flatly. She held up a sash. "Catherine Mills, 1979. Your father died in 1982. You were mayor in 1979. This is your handwriting on the label."

Vernon's lawyer put a hand on his arm. "Don't say anything else."

But Vernon was unraveling, oscillating between denial and arrogance. "This doesn't prove anything. Those could be donations. Fair queens gave their sashes to the Crowley family as tradition, as thanks for—"

"Seventeen fair queens," Hendricks interrupted. "All of whom disappeared within ninety days of their coronation. All of whom were buried under fairgrounds structures your family controlled. That's not tradition, Mr. Crowley. That's a pattern."

She pulled out more evidence bags. Under the sashes: jewelry. Cheap rings, necklaces, a locket. Personal items.

"My father—"

"Your father died three years ago. Who added these items from 1979 and 1981?" Hendricks met his eyes. "You were mayor during both those murders. Your responsibility. Your tenure. Your trophies."

Vernon's composure shattered completely. "You don't understand. The Crowley family built this town. We have responsibilities, duties. The queen tradition is ours. It belongs to us. When queens refuse to honor that tradition, refuse to respect what we've built—"

"Vernon." His lawyer's voice was sharp. "Stop talking."

But Vernon couldn't stop. The mask was gone, the entitled rage pouring out. "Ungrateful women. Given everything—crowns, opportunities, recognition—and they throw it back. They say no. They reject what we offer. They embarrass us publicly. What were we supposed to do? Just accept that? Just let them destroy our family's legacy?"

Hendricks stepped closer. "You were supposed to let them live."

Silence. Vernon seemed to hear himself for the first time. He looked at the evidence bags, the trophies, the investigators documenting everything.

"I want to go home," he said quietly.

"You'll be going to the county jail," Hendricks said. "Pending formal charges. Your lawyer can arrange bail if he thinks a judge will grant it."

Thornton looked at the evidence spread across tables, the photographs being taken, the seventeen sashes in bags.

"I'll need to consult with my client privately," he said.

"Of course." Hendricks gestured to a state trooper. "Escort them to separate vehicles. Mr. Crowley can speak with his attorney at the station."

As Vernon was led out, he passed Jessie standing near the barn entrance. He stopped, looked at her.

"Your father will lose the farm," Vernon said. Quiet, cold. "The loans, the equipment financing. All of it. He'll be destroyed."

"Maybe," Jessie said. "But he'll be free. And you'll be in prison."

Vernon's expression twisted. The trooper guided him away.

Hendricks worked until three AM, processing evidence, documenting the barn, interviewing witnesses. Aaron provided his structural analysis, walking her through how the burial sites corresponded to construction projects.

Sheriff Pritchard tried to assert jurisdiction twice. Both times, Hendricks politely but firmly informed him that this was now a state-level investigation and his department was potentially under review for corruption.

By dawn, the Crowley barn had been completely processed. The fairgrounds excavation sites were secured. Vernon Crowley was in a holding cell at the state police regional headquarters in Des Moines, separated from local influence.

And the town of Ashfield woke up Wednesday morning to learn that their mayor—third generation of the founding family—had been detained in connection with seventeen murders spanning a century.

The Crowley dynasty was over.

Aaron stood at the fairgrounds as sun rose over the excavation sites. Seventeen open graves, each marked with evidence flags and crime scene tape. Seventeen women finally visible, acknowledged, believed.

Detective Hendricks approached, exhausted but satisfied. "Your documentation was essential, Mr. Webb. The structural analysis, the financial records. This case would have been much harder without your work."

"Will it be enough to convict him?"

"The trophies alone would be hard to explain. Combined with witness testimony, financial evidence, and forensic analysis? Yes." She looked at the graves. "He'll stand trial. For all of them."

"And your sister?"

Hendricks' professional mask slipped just slightly. "I'll finally be able to bury her. After eight years of not knowing, of wondering, of hoping she'd just run away... I'll be able to bury her."

Aaron nodded. There was nothing else to say.

The sun rose higher, illuminating seventeen burial sites that Vernon Crowley would never be able to hide again.

Justice was slow. But it was coming.
