# Chapter 8: Tammy's Network

Tammy's Beauty Barn sat on Main Street between the hardware store and the pharmacy, its pink-and-white striped awning visible from three blocks away. Inside, the smell of perm solution and hairspray hung in the air like perfume. Four vinyl chairs lined one wall, two sinks at the back, posters of hairstyles from 1978 that Tammy had never bothered to update because her customers didn't want trendy—they wanted what they'd always had.

Friday morning, Tammy unlocked the door at seven-thirty and started making calls.

She had the largest information network in Eldon County, built over thirty years of doing hair six days a week. Women talked to their hairdressers. They told Tammy things they wouldn't tell their husbands, their mothers, their pastors. And Tammy, who'd always thought of herself as just a small-town gossip, was about to weaponize every connection she'd ever made.

Her first call was to Betty Larson, who ran the beauty shop in Waterloo.

"Betty? It's Tammy Sullivan. Yeah, from Ashfield. Listen, I need to ask you something about the old days, back in the fifties and sixties. You remember girls from Ashfield coming through Waterloo? Young women who supposedly left town for jobs or opportunities? ... Yeah, I thought you might. Did any of them ever actually stay in Waterloo?"

She made notes while Betty talked. No. None of them. Girls would pass through, maybe stay a night or two, but Waterloo was never the destination. Chicago, they all said. Better opportunities in Chicago.

Except none of them ever made it to Chicago either.

Tammy's next appointment arrived at eight—Doris Fletcher, seventy-two, getting her weekly wash and set. Tammy wrapped the cape around Doris's shoulders and started spraying her hair with water.

"Doris, you've lived in Ashfield your whole life, haven't you?"

"Born and raised. Never left except for my honeymoon to the Ozarks."

"You remember the fair queens from back in the day? I'm trying to put together some history for the centennial."

"Oh yes. I remember lots of them. My sister Evelyn was queen in 1948. Married Earl Thompson, had four kids."

Tammy sectioned Doris's hair, rolling it onto curlers. "What about the ones who left town? I keep hearing stories about queens who went to Chicago or got opportunities elsewhere."

Doris's expression shifted, became guarded. "Well, some girls get ideas. Think they're too good for a farming town."

"Like who?"

"Oh, Lorraine Fisher, for one. Pretty thing, but she didn't appreciate what she had. Got crowned queen and then ran off without so much as a goodbye to her poor mother. Broke that woman's heart."

Tammy's hands kept working, automatic after three decades. "Did you know Lorraine?"

"Not well. She was younger than me. But I remember people talking. Said she was getting above herself, making plans to leave. Eugene Crowley tried to help her—offered her a good secretarial position—but she was too proud to take honest work."

Tammy didn't argue. She finished rolling Doris's hair, placed her under the dryer, and picked up the phone again.

Between appointments, she called every contact she had. Shirley at the Lutheran church office. Grace who waitressed at the truck stop. Karen who taught at the high school. Mildred at the library. Women who'd lived in Ashfield for forty, fifty, sixty years. Women who remembered.

The pattern emerged slowly, built from pieces of twenty different conversations.

"...just took off one day, didn't even tell her fiancé..."

"...thought she was something special, got ideas from those magazines..."

"...broke his heart, poor man, he'd offered her everything..."

"...didn't know her place, thought she deserved better than Ashfield..."

Every missing woman had the same story structure. She'd gotten "ideas." She'd been "too proud." She'd "broken hearts." The disappearance was always framed as the woman's fault, her choice, her failure to appreciate what she had.

And always, buried in the language, was the mention of someone—usually unnamed—whose heart she'd broken when she left.

Tammy's eleven o'clock appointment was Edith Morrison, eighty-one years old, who'd been getting her hair done at the Beauty Barn since Tammy opened in 1953.

"Edith," Tammy said, leading the old woman to the sink for a wash. "You remember Eugene Crowley's time as mayor, don't you?"

"Course I do. Fine man. Did a lot for this town."

"Did you know any of the fair queens from those years?"

Edith was quiet while Tammy shampooed her thin white hair. Then: "I knew a few. Why're you asking?"

"Just curious. Trying to understand the history."

"History." Edith's voice was sad. "History's just the story the powerful tell, isn't it?"

Tammy's hands stopped. "What do you mean?"

"You're asking about the girls who disappeared. Don't pretend you're not. I can see it on your face."

"Did you know them?"

"Some of them. Not well. But I saw how Eugene Crowley looked at them. How his father Thomas looked at girls before him. How Vernon looks at them now." Edith's rheumy eyes met Tammy's in the mirror. "My husband worked for Crowley Construction for forty years. He knew things. Saw things. Never said a word, because a man doesn't cross the Crowleys in this town. Not if he wants to keep his job, keep his house, keep his family safe."

Tammy's heart was pounding. "Edith, what did your husband see?"

"He never told me. But I knew anyway. You live with a man for fifty-four years, you know when something's eating at him. When he drinks too much. When he can't sleep." Edith closed her eyes. "Albert died five years ago. Took his secrets with him. But before he went, when the cancer had him and he knew he wouldn't last, he said to me: 'The Crowleys own this town in more ways than one. Best you never ask about the bones.'"

"Bones?" Tammy whispered.

"That's all he said. Wouldn't say more, even at the end." Edith opened her eyes. "But now they've found them, haven't they? Under the fairgrounds. All those girls everyone said just left town."

Tammy nodded, unable to speak.

"I knew," Edith said softly. "Deep down, I always knew. We all did. But knowing and saying are different things. Saying could get you hurt. Get your family hurt. So we said what we were supposed to say—that the girls were ungrateful, that they chose to leave, that it was their own fault for thinking they deserved better than what Ashfield offered."

"Jesus Christ," Tammy murmured.

"Don't take the Lord's name, dear." Edith's voice was prim, automatic. Then softer: "But yes. Exactly that."

Tammy finished Edith's hair in silence, her mind racing. When Edith left—refusing to pay, saying "this one's on Albert's conscience"—Tammy sat down at her desk and looked at her notebook.

Pages and pages of notes. Twenty-seven phone calls. Fifteen conversations with customers. And every single one told the same story from different angles.

The Crowleys chose the queens. The queens who accepted Crowley attention stayed safe, stayed in town, lived normal lives. The queens who rejected that attention disappeared. And the town—the whole goddamn town—had blamed the victims for their own murders.

Including her.

Tammy thought about all the times she'd repeated these stories over the years. "Oh, you know, she got too big for her britches and ran off to the city." "She broke poor Eugene's heart when she left." "Some girls just don't appreciate what they have."

She'd been complicit. For thirty years, she'd been spreading the murderers' narrative, helping to ensure that no one questioned, no one investigated, no one spoke up.

Her one o'clock appointment was late. Tammy used the time to organize her notes into a coherent report. Names, dates, patterns of language. The victim-blaming rhetoric that had allowed seventeen murders to be explained away as voluntary departures.

The motive had been there all along, hidden in plain sight.

The Crowleys didn't just kill these women. They killed them for saying no.

By six o'clock, Tammy had a complete intelligence package. She drove to The Sunrise Cafe.

Aaron, Jessie, and Holly were in their usual booth. Wayne showed up ten minutes later, drunk, slouching at the end.

Tammy spread her notebook. "I've got your motive. It's worse than we thought."

She walked them through it. Language patterns. Victim-blaming. Edith Morrison's testimony.

"Every woman who disappeared rejected Eugene Crowley's advances," Tammy concluded. "They said no. They died for it."

"Selection through pageant," Aaron said, making notes. "Approach through opportunity. Murder for rejection."

"Power," Jessie said quietly. "Ownership. They believed they had the right. Refusal was unacceptable."

"The town helped cover it up," Tammy said, voice shaking. "For a hundred years, we've been telling their story. Making victims responsible."

"My grandma knew," Holly said, stricken. "Never said anything."

"She was scared. The Crowleys own everything. Speak up, lose everything." Tammy lit a cigarette with shaking hands. "I'm sixty-one. Spent thirty years spreading lies for murderers. Need to make it right."

Wayne laughed bitterly. "You think you're complicit? Try digging the fucking graves."

Silence.

Wayne stood, swaying. "Yeah. I dug one. Buried her. Lisa Hendricks, 1975. I was seventeen. Eugene paid me fifty bucks, said if I ever talked, he'd destroy my family. Kept quiet eight years. So don't talk to me about complicity."

He stumbled toward the door, turned back. "You want to make it right? Better be ready for what comes next. Crowleys don't let go of power easily. If Vernon suspects you're close..."

He pushed through the door.

"We need to move faster," Aaron said.

"Jessie, your barn search?" Tammy asked.

"Tomorrow. Vernon will be at the planning meeting."

"I'll come," Holly offered.

"Absolutely not. You're in the pageant. A potential victim."

Holly nodded reluctantly.

"I'll keep digging," Tammy said. "Might be more victims we haven't found."

"Seventeen we know of," Aaron said. "Could be dozens."

Tammy drove home thinking about seventeen women. Seventeen names, seventeen faces, seventeen girls crowned and killed for saying no.

Edith's husband carrying secrets to his grave. Wayne, seventeen and terrorized. Herself, spreading narratives for three decades.

All complicit. The whole town. Fear, ignorance, willful blindness.

But it ended now.

Tammy made a silent promise: Your real stories will be told. The men who killed you will face justice.

Even if it costs me everything.
