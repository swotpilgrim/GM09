# Chapter 17: Financial Control

The Eldon County Records Office smelled like old paper and dust. Monday afternoon light filtered through grimy windows, illuminating particles hanging in stale air. Aaron Webb sat at a scarred wooden table in the basement archive room, surrounded by banker's boxes and ledgers that dated back to the 1940s.

He'd been here since eight this morning. Seven hours of cross-referencing property records, business licenses, loan documents, tax filings. His eyes ached from reading faded carbon copies and handwritten entries. His notebook was filling with names, dates, dollar amounts.

And a pattern that made his stomach turn.

He adjusted his wire-rim glasses and returned to the 1979 property transfer records. The Crowley family name appeared again and again—grantor, grantee, lien holder, trust beneficiary. Sometimes outright ownership, more often buried in shell companies with bland names. Ashfield Holdings LLC. Eldon County Development Corporation. Heartland Agricultural Partners.

All Crowley money. All Crowley control.

Aaron pulled out a fresh sheet of graph paper and began mapping the connections. In the center: Vernon Eugene Crowley, current mayor. Radiating outward: businesses, properties, individuals. Lines connecting them like a spider's web.

The Crowley family owned the First Bank of Ashfield outright—majority shareholder since 1891. That gave them access to every loan, every mortgage, every business line of credit in the county. The power to approve or deny, to call in debts or extend grace.

The power to own people without them realizing it.

The grain elevator—critical infrastructure for every farmer in Eldon County—was operated by Heartland Agricultural Partners. Crowley owned sixty percent. If you farmed corn or soybeans within fifty miles of Ashfield, you sold through that elevator. There was no alternative.

Aaron traced the property records. The Crowley estate itself: two hundred acres north of town, plus another eight hundred acres scattered across the county in parcels of forty to one-sixty. Leased back to local farmers on year-to-year agreements.

Farmers like Jessie's father.

He flipped to the fairgrounds documentation. The land deed was complex: Thomas Crowley had donated the original forty acres to Eldon County in 1884 with stipulations—operational oversight remains with the Crowley family, any permanent structures require Crowley approval.

A hundred years later, Vernon Crowley still controlled every building project, every construction contract, every renovation.

Which meant Vernon decided when to dig. And where.

Aaron set down his pen, rubbing his eyes. The structural analysis made sense now—the settlement patterns he'd documented during his safety inspection. Bodies buried during construction projects that Vernon authorized, supervised, and funded.

Seventeen construction projects spanning a century. Seventeen burial sites.

He turned to the financial records that Tammy had flagged—families of the missing women. This was where the pattern became truly disturbing.

Fisher family, 1952. Lorraine Fisher crowned Fair Queen in July, vanished in September. October 1952: anonymous donation to Ashfield Lutheran Church designated for "Fisher family assistance"—$2,500. Equivalent to a year's farm income.

Brennan family, 1961. Ruth Brennan crowned in July, vanished in September. November 1961: scholarship fund established through First Bank of Ashfield for "Brennan siblings educational expenses"—$5,000.

Hendricks family, 1975. Lisa Hendricks crowned in July, vanished in September. December 1975: business loan approved for Hendricks farm equipment, interest-free for five years—$8,000. Loan forgiven in 1980, debt marked "satisfied by donor."

The amounts increased over time, tracking with inflation. Always arriving months after the disappearance. Always anonymous or laundered through the bank. Always enough money to ease the sting, to buy silence, to make asking questions seem ungrateful.

Blood money disguised as charity.

Aaron's hands clenched on the ledger. How many families suspected? How many chose not to know because the mortgage was paid, the medical bills covered, the children's education secured?

He forced himself to continue. The corruption went deeper than victim families.

Sheriff Dale Pritchard. Elected 1977. Campaign finance reports showed $15,000 in donations from "Ashfield business community"—funds traced back to Crowley-controlled accounts. Property records showed Pritchard's house purchased in 1978 for $45,000, financed through First Bank of Ashfield at two percent interest. Market value: $65,000. The difference: $20,000 of equity gifted through undervaluation.

County Coroner William Gast. Appointed 1974. His medical practice building lease: owned by Eldon County Development Corporation. Rent: $200 monthly. Comparable properties: $600-800. Subsidy over ten years: $60,000 minimum.

Tom Preston, Ashfield Gazette editor. Commercial printing press loan: $25,000 from First Bank, 1972. Original terms: fifteen-year note at eight percent. Actual payments: mysteriously restructured in 1976 to interest-only, principal deferred indefinitely. Building lease: Crowley Holdings. Below market rate.

Council members, three of five: business loans, property deals, campaign contributions. Not enough to be openly corrupt, just enough to be complicit. Enough to look the other way. Enough to vote yes when Vernon proposed bulldozing the excavation sites.

Aaron sat back, staring at his web of connections. This wasn't just murder. It was institutional capture. Vernon Crowley had purchased an entire county's silence.

The door creaked. Jessie Carter descended the stairs, expression tight.

"Aaron. Tammy said you were here."

He gestured to the empty chair. "Seven hours. It's worse than I thought."

Jessie sat heavily. "How much worse?"

Aaron turned his notebook. "Vernon controls forty percent of Ashfield's economy directly. Another twenty percent indirectly. The bank, grain elevator, farmland, real estate. Everyone here either works for Crowley, leases from Crowley, or owes Crowley money."

"Jesus."

"Sheriff, coroner, editor—all financially compromised." He flipped to victim families. "Every family that lost a daughter received money afterward. Hush money."

Jessie's face paled. "How much?"

"Thousands. Desperate families—medical bills, failing farms. Then money appears. Enough to solve their crisis."

"And accepting the money means believing the story." Jessie's voice was hollow. "Asking questions means admitting you took blood money."

"Exactly." Aaron pushed the ledgers toward her. "The system creates complicity."

Jessie scanned entries. Her finger stopped. Face went white.

"What is it?"

"Carter family. November 1979. Anonymous payment to University of Iowa Hospital. Margaret Carter." She looked up, stricken. "My mother. Cancer diagnosis that fall. Experimental treatment. My father was going to sell the farm."

"What happened?"

"The hospital called. Anonymous donor paid the balance. Twenty-three thousand dollars." Her hands shook. "We thought it was a miracle. Mom got another year. We kept the farm."

"Jessie—"

"Vernon Crowley paid for my mother's cancer treatment." She stared at the ledger. "What did he buy with that money? What didn't my father ask?"

"You didn't know."

"But what if he did?" She stood, pacing. "1979. That was another murder year, wasn't it?"

Aaron checked his timeline. "Catherine Mills. Crowned July 1979. Vanished October."

"October 1979. Same month the bill was paid." Jessie's voice broke. "Did my father know?"

Aaron stood. "Even if he suspected, he was in an impossible position. Your mother was dying. Crowley gave him a choice between family and abstract suspicion."

"That's not a choice. That's extortion."

"Yes."

"How many people made the same calculation?"

"Enough." Aaron gestured to his notes. "The system works because Vernon makes sure everyone's compromised. Pay the sheriff to ignore missing girls. Give the editor debt to kill stories. Send money to victim families. Everyone stays quiet."

Jessie sank back, deflating. "We can't fight this. He owns everyone."

"Maybe the system only works while Vernon controls the fear." Aaron sat across from her. "State police aren't on his payroll. If we document everything—murders and the financial web—it becomes criminal conspiracy. RICO, racketeering, fraud."

"That won't bring back the dead women."

"No. But it breaks the machine that protected their killer."

Jessie wiped her eyes. "The state police. Can they handle this?"

"They'll bring in the FBI. Interstate banking fraud, organized crime statutes." Aaron tapped his notebook. "I've been documenting everything."

"Vernon will destroy anyone who talks."

"Not if the FBI seizes his assets first." Aaron's voice was flat. "First forty-eight hours are critical. Once they freeze accounts, Vernon loses his power."

"When do we go to state police?"

"Day after tomorrow. Outside Ashfield." He gathered documents. "We need witness statements, physical evidence, Wayne's confession, and this. Build a case he can't escape."

"And until then?"

"Keep our heads down. Don't tell anyone." Aaron met her eyes. "Don't tell your father about the hospital payment."

Jessie's jaw tightened. "If it means stopping Vernon before he destroys evidence, yes. But after, my father and I will talk."

"Fair enough."

She stood. "I need to get back. People notice."

"One more thing." Aaron pulled out a ledger. "The centennial pageant is in six days. Every murder happened within ninety days of crowning. Usually sixty to seventy."

"You think Vernon will choose another girl."

"He believes it's his right. Holly's in the pageant."

Jessie's expression went hard. "Not anymore."

"Pull her out and it tips Vernon off. Better to maintain appearances."

"You want to use Holly as bait."

"I want her never alone. Protected." Aaron cleaned his glasses. "Vernon can't act with witnesses present. If Holly has people around constantly—you, Tammy, me—she's safe. And we maintain the illusion."

Jessie nodded. "I'll talk to Tammy. We'll keep Holly covered."

"Thank you."

She moved toward the stairs, paused. "Aaron. What you're doing—documenting this, building the case. It matters. These women deserve people to know how it happened."

"The system enabled him," Aaron said quietly. "The least we can do is expose it."

After Jessie left, Aaron returned to his documentation. Financial connections, corrupt relationships, blood money. The architecture of complicity.

Vernon hadn't worked alone. He'd purchased accomplices with loans and favors. Bought silence with strategic generosity. Built a machine that turned good people into enablers.

That machine was still running. Economic leverage remained. People terrified of Crowley empire collapse.

But some prices were too high.

Seventeen women had paid with their lives. Their families with decades of grief. The community with its soul.

No more.

Aaron boxed up documents methodically. Financial records. Property deeds. Loan documents. Evidence of systematic corruption spanning fifty years.

He carried the first box to his truck, planning offsite copies. If something happened before state police intervened, this documentation had to survive.

The truth had to survive.

Vernon's real crime wasn't just murder. It was building a system where murder was quietly accepted by a town that couldn't afford questions.

That system ended now.
