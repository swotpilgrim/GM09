# Chapter 2: The Discovery

Aaron Webb had learned in the Army Corps of Engineers that chaos was just order waiting to be documented. He photographed the bones from sixteen different angles, documenting position and context, before the patrol car arrived forty minutes later, gravel spraying under the tires.

Sheriff Dale Pritchard was a big man gone soft, with a gut hanging over his belt and a face like old leather. He pushed through the crowd without acknowledging anyone, stopped at the excavator, and peered up at the bucket with the expression of a man looking at a minor inconvenience.

"Well, hell. That's bones all right."

Aaron lowered his camera. "Sheriff Pritchard? Aaron Webb, county safety inspector. I've documented the scene but haven't allowed anyone to disturb the remains. This needs to be treated as a potential crime scene—"

"Yeah, yeah. Good." Pritchard waved a hand dismissively, already turning to the construction foreman. "Dave, you hit these at what, four feet?"

"About that. Frost line for the foundation supports."

"Probably some old family plot from before the fairgrounds." Pritchard wiped his neck with a handkerchief. "Folks used to bury on their own property. Happens when you dig in old areas."

Aaron felt something tighten in his chest. "Sheriff, with respect, this requires proper investigation. Forensic examination, chain of custody documentation, notification of state authorities—"

"Son, no need to make a big deal out of this. Fair's in ten days. We got the centennial anniversary. Town's counting on those tourism dollars. Last thing we need is panic over some bones that've been here since before any of us were born."

"State law requires notification when human remains are discovered in suspicious circumstances—"

"I know what state law requires. I've been sheriff for twelve years." Pritchard's voice hardened. "I'll call the county coroner, we'll get a proper examination, but we're keeping this quiet until we know what we're dealing with. No press, no panic. Understood?"

Aaron held the sheriff's gaze. The man's casual dismissal of protocol violated everything Aaron had been trained to do. In the military, you followed procedure because procedure saved lives. Civilians seemed to think rules were suggestions, guidelines that could be bent for convenience.

"I'll need copies of all documentation," Aaron said carefully. "For the safety inspection file."

"Sure, sure. You'll get your paperwork." Pritchard turned back to the crowd. "All right, folks, show's over. Dave, cover that bucket with a tarp and park the excavator. Nobody touches it until the coroner gets here. Everybody else, back to work. Fair prep continues."

The crowd dispersed reluctantly, murmuring. Jessie Carter lingered near the stage, her arms crossed, watching Pritchard with an expression Aaron couldn't quite read. The blonde woman from the beauty booth—Tammy—had disappeared, probably to spread the news.

Aaron made more notes in his inspection log. The sheriff's behavior bothered him. In his experience, people who wanted to keep things quiet usually had reasons beyond protecting tourism.

The county coroner arrived forty minutes later in a station wagon with magnetic signs reading "Eldon County Medical Examiner." Dr. Raymond Hess was seventy if he was a day, moving with the careful precision of someone whose joints didn't work like they used to. He examined the bones while Pritchard stood nearby, hands on his belt.

Aaron positioned himself close enough to hear, camera ready to document the examination.

"Human remains, definitely," Hess said, holding a fragment up to the light. "Female, based on the pelvic structure. Buried at least thirty years, maybe more. Hard to say without proper lab analysis."

"Cause of death?" Pritchard asked.

"Can't determine from what's here. Need the full skeleton." Hess set the bone fragment back carefully. "I'll bag these, take them to the Des Moines lab. But Dale, you should probably—"

"Yeah, I know. State forensics." Pritchard's jaw worked. "Let's just see what we've got first before we bring in the cavalry."

Aaron opened his mouth to object, but movement caught his eye. One of the workers near the livestock barn was running toward them, waving his arms.

"Sheriff! Sheriff Pritchard!"

Everyone turned. The worker—young, maybe twenty—skidded to a stop, breathing hard.

"We found more. Bones. In the livestock barn foundation. Jesus Christ, there's more."

Aaron's mind worked through the implications. Multiple burial sites suggested something organized, not random. What were the odds of hitting two separate, unrelated burials on forty acres?

The livestock barn excavation looked similar—workers digging post holes for fence supports, bones at the same depth. These remains were less intact: scattered fragments, a partial skull, a femur.

Dr. Hess knelt beside the hole, his face grim. "Same age range. Female. Same approximate burial depth."

Pritchard's face had gone red. "This doesn't make any goddamn sense."

"Sheriff, we need state forensics," Aaron said. "Two burial sites in one location? This is potentially a—"

"Don't say it." Pritchard pointed a thick finger at Aaron. "Don't start that kind of talk. We don't know what this is yet."

Jessie Carter had followed them to the barn. She stood at the edge of the excavation, her face pale. "Dale, if there are multiple people buried here, the fair can't go on. We need to—"

"The fair is going on," Pritchard said flatly. "This town has been running this fair for a hundred years. We're not stopping for some old bones."

"Some old bones?" Wayne Keller swayed behind them, smelling of alcohol. "Someone buried bodies here and you want to sell corn dogs anyway?"

"Wayne, you're drunk. Go home."

"There are dead people under the fairgrounds and you want to—"

"I want to handle this properly. No hysterics, no wild speculation, no spreading panic." Pritchard looked around. "Until we have forensic confirmation, this information does not leave this group. Clear?"

Aaron felt cold fury building. "Sheriff, containment of information about a potential crime scene could constitute obstruction—"

"Are you threatening me, Mr. Webb?"

"I'm informing you of legal realities."

Pritchard's hand rested on his belt. Aaron kept his hands relaxed, de-escalation training kicking in.

Jessie stepped between them. "Sheriff, Aaron's right this needs proper investigation. Aaron, the sheriff's the legal authority. How about Dr. Hess takes the remains for analysis, we wait for results, then make decisions based on facts?"

Pritchard's shoulders relaxed. "That's sensible."

"I'll still need to document everything for the safety inspection," Aaron said. "And I'll be filing a report with my office regardless."

"You do what you need to do." Pritchard turned away. "Dave, get tarps over both sites. Nobody digs anywhere else on these grounds until further notice. Dr. Hess, how soon can you get results?"

"State lab's backed up. Three, four days minimum."

"Fine. Keep me posted." Pritchard headed back to his patrol car without looking back.

Aaron spent the next two hours photographing and measuring both sites—depth, soil composition, exact locations. His engineering training made it automatic: sight lines, distances, positions, everything in his notebook.

Jessie helped with the measuring tape, pointing out fairground features. She didn't talk much, but her knowledge was encyclopedic.

"This barn was rebuilt in 1961," she said when Aaron asked about the construction date. "Tornado took the old one. Town came together, put it up in six weeks. My dad worked on it—he was in high school then."

Aaron made a note. "And the main stage?"

"Rebuilt 1979. I remember that one. I was about eight. They had a whole ceremony when they unveiled it."

Aaron pulled out the blueprints he'd been studying earlier. Both sites—stage and barn—showed the same pattern. Settlement cracks in foundations that shouldn't exist in structures this young. The kind of settling you got when soil had been disturbed and refilled.

He cross-referenced the burial depths with the blueprint specifications. The bodies had been buried during the construction phases, before the foundations were poured. Someone with access to the construction sites, someone who knew the schedule, someone who could bury remains without being noticed.

Someone who controlled the fairgrounds.

"Jessie," he said slowly. "Who oversees fairground construction projects?"

She thought about it. "Town council authorizes funding, but the Crowley family has operational control. They've always managed the fairgrounds. Mayor Crowley signs off on all major work."

"Which Mayor Crowley?"

"Well, Vernon now. Before him, his father Eugene. And before that, Thomas Crowley, who founded the fair back in 1883."

Aaron looked at the blueprints again. Both renovation projects—1961 and 1979—had signatures at the bottom. Eugene Crowley, Mayor. Vernon Crowley, Mayor.

He thought about the care taken with the burials, the precise depth, the timing during construction. This wasn't random. This was planned. Methodical. Someone who could arrange access, who could ensure no questions were asked, who had done it more than once.

"How many major construction projects have there been at these fairgrounds?" Aaron asked.

Jessie frowned. "I don't know. A few? There was work in the fifties sometime. And they redid the exhibition halls in the seventies."

Aaron's stomach tightened. If there were two bodies at two construction sites, what were the odds there were more?

"Jessie, I need to see all the construction records for this fairground. Every project, every blueprint, every permit filed."

She looked at him steadily. "You think there are more."

"I think we need to check."

The sun had climbed high, beating down on the fairgrounds with late summer heat. Workers moved through their tasks quietly, no one meeting each other's eyes. The festival atmosphere from this morning had evaporated, replaced by something uneasy and afraid.

Tammy Sullivan appeared from between exhibition halls, walking toward them with purpose. She'd changed her rhinestone sweatshirt for a denim jacket, and her expression was serious.

"Jessie, Aaron. We need to talk." She glanced around, making sure no one was in earshot. "I've been making calls. And there's something you need to know about the girls who've gone missing from this town over the years."

Aaron looked at the blueprints in his hands, then at the two tarp-covered excavation sites, then at Tammy's grim expression.

They were just starting to understand what they'd uncovered.

And it was going to get worse.
