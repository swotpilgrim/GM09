# Chapter 25: Eugene's Shadow

Tammy Sullivan sat in the viewing room at Shady Oaks Nursing Home, watching state police attempt to interview Eugene Crowley through a two-way mirror. The old man sat slumped in a wheelchair, staring at nothing. Eighty-two years old, advanced dementia, barely coherent on his best days.

On his worst days—like today—he didn't remember his own name.

Detective Hendricks sat across from him. "Mr. Crowley, do you remember the fairgrounds? The construction projects you supervised?"

Eugene's watery eyes drifted past her shoulder. "What?"

"The fairgrounds. Do you remember working there?"

"Vernon handles that. I'm retired." Eugene's voice was thin. "Where's my lunch?"

A nursing home aide stood by the door. She'd warned them—Eugene had good days and bad days. Today was bad.

But two days ago, he'd been lucid for almost an hour. Long enough to call state police.

Hendricks tried again. "Do you remember teaching Vernon about family responsibilities?"

Something flickered in Eugene's expression. Muscle memory surfacing through fog.

"Vernon's a good boy. Learns what I teach him. Crowley men... we maintain order. Can't let women..." He trailed off. "What was the question?"

"What did you teach Vernon about women?"

Eugene's face went blank. "Women? I had a wife. Where's Nancy?"

The aide stepped forward. "Mrs. Crowley doesn't visit anymore."

"She should visit. Good wife. Knows her place."

Tammy watched through the glass, stomach churning. This man had murdered at least eight women. Maybe more—the timeline suggested Eugene had participated in his father Thomas's murders, learned the method, perfected it, passed it to Vernon.

But the Eugene Crowley sitting in that wheelchair wasn't capable of standing trial. Wasn't capable of understanding the charges against him. His brain had deteriorated to the point where he couldn't follow simple conversations, couldn't remember what year it was, couldn't distinguish past from present.

The state's psychiatric evaluation had been clear: incompetent to stand trial. Unable to assist in his own defense. Dementia had destroyed the man who'd destroyed so many lives.

Hendricks continued for twenty minutes. Eugene drifted in and out, occasionally lucid enough to make disturbing comments.

"Barn's useful. Good place for..." Confusion. "What were we talking about?"

"Did you teach Vernon how to handle things?"

Eugene's eyes sharpened momentarily. "Crowley men have responsibilities. When women don't understand their place, refuse opportunities, threaten family reputation... you handle it. Clean. Quick. My father taught me. I taught Vernon. That's tradition."

Hendricks leaned forward. "How did you handle it?"

And just like that, the lucidity vanished. Eugene stared blankly. "Handle what? Who are you?"

The interview ended. Eugene was wheeled back to his room.

Tammy met Hendricks in the nursing home parking lot. October wind cut through her jacket.

"That's our murderer," Tammy said. "Can't remember what day it is, but two days ago he described teaching Vernon to kill women in complete sentences."

"I've seen the lucid interview video." Hendricks pulled out a folder. "Forty-three minutes of coherent testimony. Described selecting victims, methods, burial locations. Talked about maintaining family order. Then asked for pudding and forgot the entire conversation."

"Can you use any of it?"

"In court? No. His lawyer will argue he doesn't understand the proceedings. Which is true. Eugene Crowley murdered at least eight women we can document. And he'll never stand trial."

Tammy leaned against her car. "That's not justice."

"No. It's dementia." Hendricks looked back at Shady Oaks. "The man who committed those murders doesn't exist anymore. Just fragments, surfacing occasionally through brain damage."

"So he gets away with it."

"He's dying. Pneumonia's setting in, kidneys failing. Doctor gives him two weeks, maybe three." Hendricks' expression was grim. "Eugene Crowley will die in that nursing home without ever facing trial. Without ever being held accountable for Lisa or the seven others he killed."

"What about his wife? Nancy. Can she testify?"

"We interviewed her yesterday. Want to hear the recording?"

They sat in Hendricks' vehicle. She played the interview on cassette. Nancy Crowley's voice came through tinny and frightened.

*"I didn't know. I never knew anything."*

*"Mrs. Crowley, you lived in that house for forty years. You never suspected?"*

*"Vernon controlled everything—where I went, who I talked to, what I spent. If I asked questions, he'd get angry. Reminded me I had nowhere to go."*

*"Did you suspect he was hurting people?"*

*Long silence.*

*"I knew girls went missing. The fair queens. Vernon would be... different afterward. Tense, then calm again. Like something had been resolved."*

*"But you never asked?"*

*"Have you ever been married to a man who monitors your phone calls? Who checks your car mileage? Who implies that if you make trouble, you'll regret it?"*

*"Did you know about the trophy trunk?"*

*Silence.*

*"I saw it once. 1978. Found the trunk in the barn, saw the sashes. Asked Vernon. He said they were fair memorabilia, donations from grateful families. I believed him because believing was safer than questioning."*

*"You didn't think seventeen sashes from missing women was suspicious?"*

*"I thought survival was more important than curiosity."*

The recording ended. Tammy sat quietly for a moment.

"She knew," Tammy said finally. "Maybe not details, but she knew something was wrong."

"Yes."

"But she was terrified. Isolated. Financially dependent. Classic domestic abuse pattern—control, intimidation, implied threats."

"Also yes."

"So is she a victim or an accomplice?"

Hendricks ejected the cassette. "Both. Nancy Crowley was abused, controlled, and silenced. She's also a woman who saw evidence of murder and chose to look away because confronting it was dangerous."

Tammy thought about the women who'd come through her salon over the years. Bruises covered with makeup. Quiet desperation masked by small talk.

She'd recognized the patterns. Sometimes intervened. Sometimes women took the help. Often they didn't—going back to dangerous men because leaving seemed more dangerous than staying.

Was Nancy Crowley any different?

"What happens to her now?" Tammy asked.

"Nothing. She's not being charged. Can't prove she actively participated in any crimes, and her testimony is useless—everything she knows is secondhand suspicion. She claims ignorance, and we can't prove otherwise."

"So she just... walks away."

"She loses everything else. Crowley assets are being seized, estate liquidated. She'll get a small settlement—enough to rent an apartment somewhere, buy a used car. But the mansion, the money, the family name? Gone."

Tammy looked at the nursing home. "And Eugene dies in there, never prosecuted."

"In about two weeks, according to his doctor. Pneumonia and kidney failure. He'll die in his sleep, probably. Comfortable. Medicated. Surrounded by staff who don't know he's a serial killer."

The unfairness of it burned. Eight women dead by Eugene's hands, seventeen dead across three generations, and the first two Crowley murderers would escape earthly justice entirely. Thomas died in 1952, long before anyone connected the pattern. Eugene would die senile and comfortable.

Only Vernon would face trial.

That evening, the group met at Jessie's farmhouse—Jessie, Aaron, Tammy, Holly. Wayne still missing.

Tammy shared what she'd learned about Eugene and Nancy.

"Nancy's a victim," Tammy said firmly. "Abused wife, isolated, terrified. Vernon controlled every aspect of her life. Questioning him could've gotten her killed."

"Nancy saw the trophy trunk," Aaron countered. "Seventeen sashes from missing women. Chose to believe Vernon's lie because it was convenient."

"Because it was safe."

"Is there a difference?" Aaron's voice was measured. "I understand Nancy was afraid. But seventeen women died, and she suspected something was wrong but said nothing. At what point does self-preservation become complicity?"

Tammy bristled. "You've never been in an abusive relationship. You don't understand the psychology."

"I understand that every day Nancy stayed silent, Vernon was free to kill again."

Jessie raised a hand. "Both of you have points. Nancy was a victim of Vernon's abuse. But her silence—however justified by fear—enabled the murders to continue. Both things can be true."

Holly sat quiet, listening. Finally: "My grandmother stayed quiet too. About Ruth. Believed the story that Ruth ran away because believing was easier than investigating. Does that make Grandma Vera complicit?"

"No," Tammy said immediately. "Your grandmother didn't live with the murderer. Didn't have access to evidence. She was lied to by authorities, by the community, by people she trusted."

"But if she'd pushed harder, maybe the pattern would've been exposed sooner."

"Or maybe she would've been ignored, dismissed, threatened. We can't hold victims responsible for crimes they didn't commit."

Aaron set down his coffee. "I agree. But Nancy had information—saw the trophies, knew about the barn. She could've called police anonymously. Could've left town and reported from safety. She chose not to."

"Because she was terrified."

"Because she prioritized her own survival over seventeen women's lives." Aaron's tone was gentle. "I don't blame her for that—survival instinct is powerful. But I won't call her blameless either."

Tammy wanted to argue further. But she thought about the trophy trunk, seventeen sashes, seventeen names. Nancy had seen that evidence in 1978. Five years before Diana Foster's murder.

If Nancy had reported it then, would Diana still be alive?

The question was impossible to answer. Some situations had no clean moral resolution. Nancy was both victim and enabler. Abused and complicit. Terrified and silent.

Women could be harmed by patriarchy and still participate in it. Could be victimized and still fail other victims.

It was complicated. Uncomfortable. True.

"Eugene dies in two weeks," Tammy said, changing the subject. "Never prosecuted. Never held accountable."

"I know," Aaron said quietly.

"That's not justice."

"No. It's not."

Holly looked up. "The singing includes him. Eugene's victims. I hear them in the harmonies—older, different pain. They know he's dying unpunished."

"What do they want?" Jessie asked.

"Acknowledgment. To be remembered, believed, honored. Eugene escaping trial doesn't change that."

Tammy thought about Eugene in his wheelchair, fragments of lucidity revealing the monster beneath dementia. Talking about teaching Vernon, handling difficult women. No remorse. Just entitlement, preserved through brain damage.

He'd die comfortable. His victims had died terrified.

But they'd be remembered. Eugene Crowley would be remembered too—not as Ashfield's respected businessman, but as a serial killer who taught his son to murder.

Maybe that was justice of a different kind.

Two weeks later, Eugene Crowley died of pneumonia in Shady Oaks Nursing Home. The death certificate listed natural causes. The obituary was four sentences long, published in the Ashfield Gazette without ceremony or mourning.

No funeral. No memorial service. Nancy arranged cremation, scattered his ashes somewhere private, never disclosed the location.

The man who'd murdered eight women and taught his son to murder nine more vanished without trial, without accountability, without justice.

Vernon would stand trial alone, carrying three generations of family tradition into court. The weight of Thomas's murders, Eugene's murders, and his own.

Whether that was fair or simply all they could get, Tammy never decided.

Some justice was incomplete. But it was all seventeen women would receive.
