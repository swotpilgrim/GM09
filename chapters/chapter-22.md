# Chapter 22: Wayne's Choice

The interrogation room at Iowa State Police Regional Headquarters smelled like cleaner and stale coffee. Wednesday afternoon, Wayne Keller sat across from Detective Sarah Hendricks with a folder between them.

His sworn statement. Everything he'd told Aaron Webb, now typed and formal. Every detail of September 1975. Every moment helping Eugene Crowley dispose of Lisa Hendricks' body.

Sarah Hendricks read through it a second time. Her sister's name appeared seventeen times. Each mention precise, devastating.

Wayne watched her read. Sober for the first time in eight years that mattered. He'd drunk away the guilt every night, tried to drown the memory. But alcohol couldn't erase truth.

Lisa Hendricks had been murdered. And he'd helped hide it.

"Mr. Keller." Hendricks set down the statement. Her voice was professional, controlled. But Wayne saw the grief underneath. "I need you to walk me through this again. Not the statement. Your words. What happened the night my sister died?"

Wayne's hands shook. He clasped them together on the table. "I was seventeen. Working at my dad's garage. Eugene Crowley was a regular customer. Brought his farm trucks in for maintenance."

"Go on."

"September 15, 1975. Ten PM. Eugene pulled into the garage. Had his pickup, tarp in the bed. Said he needed help moving something heavy. Offered a hundred dollars cash. Two weeks' wages."

"Did you know what you were moving?"

"Not at first. Tarp was wrapped tight. But when we loaded it... I felt the weight. I knew." He looked up. "I knew it was a body. But Eugene was looking at me with this cold expression. Like daring me to say something."

"Did he threaten you?"

"Said my father's garage had a loan through First Bank. Said the Crowley family owned that bank. If I talked, my dad's business would be destroyed. My family would lose everything."

Wayne's hands clenched. "I was seventeen. Scared. So I helped."

"Where did you take the body?"

"Fairgrounds. Construction on new livestock barns. Foundation poured that week, still curing. We buried her in the excavation, under what would be the barn floor."

Sarah's jaw tightened. "Did Eugene say anything while you worked?"

"He talked about family responsibility. Traditions. How some women couldn't be grateful for opportunities." Wayne's voice broke. "He talked about your sister like she was inconvenient. Like she'd brought it on herself by refusing him."

"Refusing what?"

"He didn't explain. Just kept saying she'd embarrassed the family, rejected opportunities, needed to be dealt with." Wayne wiped his eyes. "When we finished, Eugene paid me two hundred dollars. Doubled the amount. Then reminded me that silence was the smartest choice for everyone."

"And you never told anyone?"

"Who would I tell? The sheriff, the mayor, the bank—all Crowley. I was a kid who'd helped dispose of a body. Eugene made sure I knew I was complicit. If I talked, I'd go to prison too."

"So you drank instead."

"Yeah. Eight years trying to forget. Didn't work. I remembered every detail, every night."

Sarah pulled out another folder. "Mr. Keller, the county prosecutor is prepared to charge you as an accessory after the fact. Obstruction of justice. Conspiracy to conceal a homicide. You could face twenty years."

Wayne nodded. "I know."

"However." She opened the folder. "Given your age at the time, the coercion you experienced, and your cooperation now, my office has negotiated a deal. You testify fully and truthfully against Vernon Crowley in all related trials. In exchange, you receive immunity from prosecution and entry into witness protection if needed."

Wayne stared. "Immunity."

"Full immunity. Your testimony is critical, Mr. Keller. Without it, we have trophies and burial sites, but no direct witness to how the murders happened. You can provide that. You can testify that you personally witnessed Eugene Crowley dispose of Lisa Hendricks's body. You can establish the pattern, the method, the family involvement."

"And I just... walk away? Free?"

Sarah's expression hardened. "You walk away with the knowledge that you helped bury my sister and stayed silent for eight years. You walk away knowing seventeen women died and you could have stopped it after the first one. That's not freedom, Mr. Keller. That's a different kind of prison."

Wayne flinched. "I'm sorry. I know that's not enough, but—"

"No. It's not enough." Sarah's control cracked slightly. "Lisa was eighteen years old. She wanted to be a veterinarian. She loved horses, hated math, made terrible jokes. She was my little sister. And you helped bury her like trash."

Silence.

Sarah composed herself. "But you're also a witness. And justice for seventeen women is more important than my personal feelings about your choices. So I'm offering you a deal. Take it. Testify. Help us convict Vernon Crowley and expose a century of systematic murder."

Wayne signed the immunity agreement with shaking hands.

Over the next two days, he gave six hours of recorded testimony. Every detail of September 1975. Eugene's demeanor, his words, his casual explanation of "family traditions." The location of the burial, the method, the threats made to ensure silence.

He described the trophy trunk—he'd seen it in the Crowley barn years earlier when delivering parts, saw the sashes, wondered what they meant. Never connected them to the murders until Aaron started investigating.

He provided information about the Crowley family's economic control, their leverage over town officials, their manipulation of grief-stricken families.

His testimony was devastating. Detailed, credible, damning.

When it was over, Sarah reviewed the transcripts. "This is good. Strong. A defense attorney will attack your credibility—criminal history, alcohol abuse, eight years of silence—but the core testimony holds."

"What happens now?" Wayne asked.

"You're free to go. Maintain contact with my office. Trial likely won't start for six to eight months. You'll be called as a key witness."

Wayne stood, uncertain. "Can I... do you want to know anything else about Lisa? About that night?"

Sarah's expression went cold. "I want you to leave. I want you to live with what you did. And I want you to show up when the trial starts so my sister's murderer goes to prison. That's all I want from you."

Wayne nodded. He walked out of the interrogation room, down the corridor, through the state police headquarters.

Outside, September sunshine, warm and bright. Ashfield was forty miles away. His truck was still at the fairgrounds where he'd left it Tuesday night.

Jessie was waiting in the parking lot, leaning against her pickup. She'd driven up to give him a ride back.

"How'd it go?" she asked.

"I testified. They gave me immunity." Wayne climbed into the passenger seat. "I'm free."

They drove in silence for twenty minutes. Finally, Wayne said, "I don't feel free."

"I know."

"I helped bury her, Jessie. Lisa Hendricks. I was seventeen and scared, but I knew what I was doing. I knew it was wrong. And I did it anyway."

Jessie kept her eyes on the highway. "What are you going to do now?"

"I don't know."

That was Wednesday afternoon. By Thursday morning, Wayne Keller was gone.

---

Tammy called Jessie at seven AM Thursday. "Wayne's trailer is empty. Truck's missing. Landlord says he cleared out overnight."

Jessie drove to the trailer park immediately. Wayne's place stood with the door open, swinging in the breeze. Inside: nothing. No clothes, no furniture, no personal belongings. The refrigerator door hung open, empty shelves. The trash can contained only a few beer cans and fast-food wrappers.

On the kitchen counter: three sealed envelopes.

One addressed to Detective Sarah Hendricks. One to Jessie Carter. One to "Mrs. Hendricks, Lisa's Mother."

Jessie opened hers with shaking hands.

*Jessie,*

*I know taking the immunity deal makes me a coward. I should face trial, go to prison, pay for what I did. But I can't. I can't stand in front of Lisa's family and hear them describe what my silence cost them. I can't stay in Ashfield knowing everyone knows what I helped do.*

*My testimony is recorded. Six hours of it. If the trial happens, they can use it. But I can't be there. I'm sorry.*

*I sent money to my ex-wife in Omaha. Child support for the kid I never knew. Not enough to make up for being a deadbeat, but it's something.*

*Tell Aaron I'm grateful. Tell Tammy I'm sorry. Tell Holly to stay brave.*

*I hope Vernon rots in prison. I hope the seventeen women get justice. I hope Ashfield learns to be better.*

*I can't be part of that. I have to go.*

*Wayne*

Jessie called Detective Hendricks immediately. "Wayne's disappeared. Left his trailer, took everything, left letters."

"Damn it." Hendricks was quiet for a moment. "Did he leave contact information?"

"No. Just... apologies."

"His truck?"

"Gone. Wyoming plates. Could be anywhere by now."

Hendricks swore again. "His testimony is recorded and admissible, but having him physically present at trial would be stronger. A defense attorney can argue recorded testimony lacks credibility if the witness isn't available for cross-examination."

"Can you find him?"

"We'll try. But if he doesn't want to be found..." Hendricks sighed. "Did he say anything in the letter about where he was going?"

"No. Just that he couldn't stay."

"Coward," Hendricks said quietly. "He gets immunity, gets freedom, and he runs."

Jessie thought about Wayne's face when he'd said *I don't feel free*. About eight years of drinking to forget. About the weight of helping bury a murdered girl when you were barely more than a kid yourself.

"Maybe," Jessie said. "Or maybe he just couldn't carry it anymore."

Wayne's truck was found three days later in Casper, Wyoming. Abandoned at a truck stop, keys in the ignition, no signs of violence or struggle. The cab was empty except for a receipt from a Western Union office in Cheyenne.

Two weeks after that, Wayne's ex-wife in Omaha received $3,000 via anonymous money order. No return address, postmark too blurred to read.

Investigators searched but found no trace. Wayne Keller had vanished.

At the trial preparation meetings, prosecutors discussed whether to pursue charges for fleeing or to accept that his recorded testimony would have to suffice. Eventually, they decided the latter. Vernon Crowley was the priority, not a scared accomplice who'd cooperated and then run.

Jessie never heard from Wayne again. Neither did Tammy, Holly, or Aaron. He'd simply disappeared, like so many others in Ashfield's history.

But unlike the seventeen queens, Wayne had chosen to leave. Had chosen to start over somewhere else, carrying his guilt to a place where no one knew his name or his crimes.

Whether that was redemption or cowardice, Jessie never decided.

Maybe it was both.
