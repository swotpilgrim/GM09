# Chapter 20: The Bulldozers

The bulldozers arrived at the Eldon County Fairgrounds at ten PM Tuesday night. Two massive Caterpillar D7s, diesel engines rumbling, headlights cutting through darkness. Behind them, a dump truck loaded with fill dirt and a cement mixer truck from a company in Cedar Rapids.

The construction foreman—a thick-set man named Rick Paulson who'd driven down from Waterloo—climbed out of the lead pickup, checking his work order. Emergency repair, the paperwork said. Level unsafe excavation sites, pour temporary foundations for centennial fair public safety. Cash payment, double overtime, finish by sunrise.

He'd been in construction twenty years. Never seen a job this rushed, this late at night, this much cash. But double overtime was double overtime.

His crew—four men, also from out of county—began setting up work lights around the fairgrounds. Diesel generators roared to life. Halogen floods illuminated the excavation sites: seventeen holes scattered across the property, each marked with police tape and evidence flags.

Paulson radioed his lead operator. "Start with the livestock barn site. Level it, backfill, move to the next. We've got six hours to fill seventeen holes."

The first bulldozer lurched forward, blade lowering toward the excavation where they'd found the bones.

Then headlights appeared on the access road. Pickup trucks, cars, a beauty salon van. Vehicles screeching to stops, people spilling out.

Paulson swore. "What the hell?"

Tammy had called Jessie at nine-thirty. "Council approved it. Vernon's bringing bulldozers tonight. Ten PM. He's destroying the evidence."

Jessie was out the door in minutes, truck engine roaring as she tore down gravel roads toward town. She called Aaron from the gas station payphone, hand shaking as she dialed.

"Fairgrounds. Ten PM. Vernon's bulldozing the burial sites."

Aaron's response was immediate, calm. "I'm calling Detective Hendricks. Stall them however you can. I'll be there in ten minutes."

Tammy made more calls. Holly. Wayne. Then she started working through her network—women from the salon, families of victims, people she thought might stand up. Some said no, too frightened of Crowley retaliation. Others said yes.

By the time Jessie reached the fairgrounds, there were already a dozen people gathered. Holly and her grandparents. Tammy and three women from her salon. Margaret Fisher—Lorraine's cousin. Two men Jessie recognized from church.

And the bulldozers, massive and yellow in the work lights, engines idling. One was already positioned over Ruth Brennan's burial site.

Jessie didn't think. She ran, placing herself directly between the bulldozer blade and the excavation.

The operator, startled, killed the engine. Silence except for the generators.

Foreman Paulson approached, work order in hand. "Ma'am, you need to move. This is an active construction site. Town council authorized emergency repairs."

"Authorized destroying evidence," Jessie said. Her voice carried across the fairgrounds. "Those aren't repairs. Those are burial sites. Seventeen women were murdered and buried here. You're being paid to bury them again."

Paulson looked uncomfortable. "I have a work order. Signed by the mayor, approved by the council."

"The mayor is the killer." Holly stepped forward, voice shaking but firm. "My great-aunt is buried under that barn. Ruth Brennan. She was eighteen years old when she disappeared. We just found her bones last week."

More vehicles arrived. Aaron's truck. Wayne's beat-up Chevy. A station wagon carrying an elderly couple Jessie didn't immediately recognize.

The old woman approached the excavation sites slowly, leaning on her husband's arm. She stopped at one marked "Hendricks, L. 1975."

"Lisa," she whispered. "My baby girl."

Mrs. Hendricks. Lisa's mother. Someone had called her.

She looked at Paulson. "My daughter is buried here. I thought she ran away. For eight years I thought she abandoned us. But she's been here the whole time. Under the ground. You're not covering her up again. I won't allow it."

Paulson radioed someone. A minute later, a county sheriff's vehicle pulled up. Sheriff Pritchard stepped out, looking tired and cornered.

"Folks, you need to disperse. This is authorized construction. You're interfering with town business."

"We're protecting evidence." Aaron stood beside Jessie, camera around his neck, already photographing everything. "Seventeen homicide victims. If those sites are destroyed, the investigation is compromised."

"Investigation's being handled," Pritchard said. "Town council authorized these repairs for public safety."

"The town council is controlled by the primary suspect," Aaron said flatly. "This is obstruction of justice. I've already called Iowa State Police DCI. Detective Sarah Hendricks is en route. ETA two hours."

Pritchard's face paled. "You called state police?"

"Twenty minutes ago. She's bringing forensic teams and arrest warrants. I suggest you step back and let us preserve this crime scene until they arrive."

More trucks arriving. Townspeople, drawn by phone calls and rumors. The crowd swelled—twenty people, thirty, forty. Some came to support the group blocking the bulldozers. Others came to support Vernon, to restore order, to make this all go away so the centennial fair could proceed.

Divisions became visible. Victims' families on one side. Crowley dependents on the other. The town splitting down the middle in real time.

A man Jessie recognized—Dan Kowalski, who leased farmland from Crowley Holdings—shouted from the growing crowd. "Let them work! Vernon's right. We need to move on. The fair is in six days. Our economy depends on it."

"Seventeen women died," Tammy shot back. "That's more important than a fair."

"Those women died decades ago! We can't change that. But we can save this town from being destroyed by scandal."

"The town's already destroyed." Mrs. Hendricks' voice cut through the argument. Quiet but steel underneath. "It's been destroyed for a hundred years. We just didn't know it."

Jessie felt the crowd shift. Some people uncertain, questioning. The narrative was cracking.

Then Vernon Crowley arrived.

His Cadillac pulled up fast, gravel spraying. He stepped out, fury barely contained beneath politician's polish. Sheriff Pritchard moved toward him immediately, speaking in low tones.

Vernon's expression darkened. He scanned the crowd—forty, fifty people now, blocking his construction crew. He saw Mrs. Hendricks standing at her daughter's grave. Saw Holly beside Vera Brennan at Ruth's excavation. Saw Jessie, arms crossed, standing directly in front of the bulldozer blade.

"This is illegal assembly," Vernon announced, voice carrying. "Sheriff Pritchard, clear these people out."

Pritchard looked between Vernon and the crowd. "Sir, they're not violent. They're just... standing there."

"They're interfering with authorized town business. Arrest them for obstruction."

"All of them?" Pritchard's voice cracked. "There's fifty people here."

"Start with the ringleaders." Vernon pointed at Jessie, Aaron, Tammy. "Them. Now."

Pritchard didn't move.

"That's an order, Sheriff."

"I..." Pritchard looked at Mrs. Hendricks, standing vigil over her daughter's grave. "I can't."

Vernon's composure finally shattered. "You work for me. This town works for me. My family built every structure here, employed half these people, funded their children's education. I will not be defied by ungrateful—"

"Your family murdered seventeen women." Jessie's voice rang out clear. "You can't bulldoze that. You can't buy silence anymore. And you can't threaten us into letting you destroy evidence."

Vernon moved toward her. The crowd shifted, some people stepping forward protectively.

"Move aside," Vernon said, low and dangerous.

"No."

"I said move." He grabbed her arm.

Aaron's hand shot out, gripping Vernon's wrist. "Touch her again and you'll be charged with assault on top of everything else."

They locked eyes. Vernon's mask was gone completely—the entitled fury of a man who'd never been told no, never been denied, never faced consequences.

"The Crowley family built Ashfield," Vernon hissed. "We own this land. We own these people. You don't understand what you're destroying."

"A system that enabled murder," Aaron said. "That's what we're destroying."

Vernon wrenched free, turned to Paulson. "Get these people out of the way and start filling those holes. I'm paying you double. Triple."

Paulson looked at his crew. Looked at Mrs. Hendricks. Looked at the grave markers and evidence flags.

"No," he said quietly. "I ain't part of this. Whatever this is, I ain't part of it."

He walked to his truck, crew following. Engines starting, vehicles pulling away. The bulldozers sat silent, abandoned.

Vernon stood alone, surrounded by a crowd that was no longer afraid. His power—economic, political, social—dissolving like morning fog.

"You'll all pay for this," he said. Desperate, cornered. "Every loan, every lease, every debt. I'll call them all in. You'll lose your farms, your businesses, everything."

"Maybe," Jessie said. "But you'll lose more. Your freedom. Your family name. Your legacy. We'd rather lose money than live in a town where murder is acceptable."

Sirens cut through the night. Distant but approaching. Blue and red lights visible on the highway.

Vernon heard them. His face went white.

"Iowa State Police," Aaron said. "Detective Sarah Hendricks, Division of Criminal Investigation. She'll want to talk to you about seventeen counts of murder, systematic corruption, obstruction of justice, and destruction of evidence."

The sirens grew louder. Three vehicles, four, lights and sirens, pulling into the fairgrounds. State police cruisers, unmarked detective cars, a crime scene van.

Detective Sarah Hendricks stepped out of the lead vehicle. Tall, professional, wearing a DCI windbreaker. She looked at the crowd, the abandoned bulldozers, Vernon standing isolated and exposed.

Then she looked at the excavation sites. Her eyes found the one marked "Hendricks, L. 1975."

Her jaw tightened. She turned to Vernon Crowley.

"Mr. Mayor. I'm Detective Hendricks, Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. I have questions about your family's activities over the past hundred years. And based on what I'm seeing here—attempted destruction of a crime scene—I think we should have that conversation at the station."

"I want my lawyer," Vernon said.

"That's your right." Hendricks gestured to a uniformed officer. "Read him his rights."

As Pritchard stood paralyzed, the state trooper stepped forward with handcuffs.

Vernon Crowley, mayor of Ashfield, third-generation master of Eldon County, was arrested at ten forty-seven PM on Tuesday, September 20, 1983.

The crowd watched in silence as he was led to a patrol car. Some people cried. Some cheered quietly. Most just stood there, witnessing the end of something that had controlled their town for a century.

Jessie found herself beside Mrs. Hendricks, both of them looking at the grave site.

"Thank you," Mrs. Hendricks said quietly. "For not letting him bury her twice."

Jessie couldn't speak. She just nodded.

The bulldozers sat dark and silent. The excavation sites remained open. Seventeen women remained visible, acknowledged, remembered.

Justice was coming. Finally.
