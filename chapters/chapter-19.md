# Chapter 19: Vernon's Move

The Carter farm kitchen smelled like coffee and morning. Tuesday, nine o'clock, and Jessie was washing dishes when she heard tires on gravel.

Black Cadillac, immaculate. Mayor Vernon Crowley stepped out, straightening his tie, briefcase in hand.

Jessie's stomach tightened. Her father was in the barn. She was alone. Vernon had timed this deliberately.

She opened the door before he could knock. "Mayor Crowley. This is unexpected."

Vernon's smile was practiced, political. "Jessie. Hope I'm not intruding. Fair logistics. Centennial planning. You've been such a help."

Lies wrapped in courtesy. Vernon never "drove by" anywhere.

"Of course. Coffee?"

"That would be lovely."

She poured two cups, feeling his eyes on her. The kitchen felt smaller. Vernon settled into her father's chair and opened his briefcase.

"I wanted to discuss the centennial pageant schedule," Vernon said, pulling out papers. "We're six days out. Rehearsals start tomorrow. Holly's registered, correct?"

"Yes." Jessie sat across from him, coffee cup between her hands like a shield.

"Wonderful girl. Vera Brennan's granddaughter." Vernon's tone was conversational, eyes flat. "Such a tragedy about Vera's sister. Ruth. Did you know I was engaged to Ruth briefly? Summer of '61. Beautiful young woman. Shame she chose to leave Ashfield."

The casual mention of Ruth—buried under the fairgrounds—sent ice through Jessie's veins. Vernon was sending a message.

"I didn't know that."

"Ancient history. But it makes me think about family legacies. The Carters. Your father, for instance. Pillar of the community. Terrible thing, what happened with your mother's illness."

There it was. The first threat, wrapped in sympathy.

"We got through it."

"You did. And the farm survived. So many operations would have folded under that financial pressure." Vernon set down his cup. "Medical bills, experimental treatments. Costs that could destroy a family's heritage. But your father kept this land. That takes remarkable resilience. Or remarkable help."

Jessie's hands tightened on her mug. He was telling her he knew. Crowley money had paid her mother's hospital bills. Silence had been purchased.

"The Crowley family has always been generous to Ashfield," Vernon continued. "My grandfather, my father, myself. We've built relationships, helped neighbors through difficult times. That's what community means. Taking care of each other."

"Is that what you call it?" The words escaped before Jessie could stop them.

Vernon's smile didn't falter, but his eyes went colder. "I call it responsibility. The Crowley family built this town. The bank, grain elevator, fairgrounds. We've provided employment, loans, infrastructure for a hundred years. That creates obligations."

"Obligations."

"Yes. I help people—pay hospital bills, forgive loans. In return, I expect loyalty. Gratitude. Not ungrateful children stirring up trouble, making wild accusations."

The mask was slipping.

"What trouble?" Jessie kept her voice steady.

"The fairgrounds excavation. This... investigation. Bodies being dug up, sensational stories, outside agitators turning neighbors against each other. It's destructive. Bad for everyone."

"Seventeen women were murdered."

"That's one interpretation." Vernon's voice went flat. "Another interpretation is that we're seeing natural deaths over a century, burials that were common practice for the time, being sensationalized by people who don't understand Ashfield's history."

Jessie stared at him. "You can't actually believe—"

"What I believe doesn't matter. What matters is this town's future. The centennial fair, our economic stability, our reputation. All threatened by reckless speculation." He paused. "Your father understands that. He's lived here his whole life. He knows how things work. I'd hate to see the Carter farm suffer because his daughter made poor choices."

There it was. The threat, naked and direct.

"You're threatening my father."

"I'm explaining reality." Vernon closed his briefcase with a decisive snap. "The Crowley family has been good to the Carters. Very good. It would be tragic if that relationship soured. If loans were called in. If equipment financing became unavailable. If grain elevator access was... restricted. Your father is sixty-three years old, Jessie. Too old to start over."

Jessie's fear crystallized into fury. "You're going to blackmail me into silence."

"I'm reminding you of your obligations. Of what you owe. Of what you stand to lose." Vernon stood, smoothing his tie. "The centennial fair happens in six days. I expect cooperation, not sabotage. Holly participates in the pageant as planned. You coordinate vendor logistics as assigned. And you stop encouraging outside interference in town business."

He moved toward the door, paused with his hand on the handle.

"Your mother was a good woman, Jessie. Your father did everything he could to save her. Sometimes accepting help is the right choice. Sometimes asking too many questions is... unwise."

The door closed behind him. Through the window, Jessie watched him drive away, gravel dust rising behind the Cadillac.

Her hands were shaking. She set down her coffee cup before she could drop it.

Vernon knew. Knew they were organizing, knew they had evidence, knew they were planning to go to state police. And he was making his move—economic threats, intimidation, reminding everyone of their dependencies and debts.

The question was: how much did he know? Did he know about Wednesday's meeting with Detective Hendricks? Did he know about Aaron's documentation?

Jessie needed to warn the others. Now.

---

Aaron Webb sat in his motel room, organizing files for Wednesday's meeting, when he heard the knock. Firm, official. The kind of knock cops made.

He checked through the window. Sheriff Dale Pritchard, in uniform. And behind him, Mayor Vernon Crowley.

Aaron opened the door but didn't step aside. "Sheriff. Mayor. What can I do for you?"

"Mr. Webb." Pritchard's tone was official, uncomfortable. "Need to have a word with you about the fairgrounds investigation."

"I'm not involved in the investigation. I conducted a safety inspection at the request of town officials."

"Nevertheless." Vernon pushed past the sheriff, stepping into the room uninvited. His eyes scanned the space—case files on the dresser, photographs spread across the bed, Aaron's notebook open on the desk. "We have concerns."

Aaron's hand moved subtly to his briefcase, fingers finding the micro-cassette recorder he kept there—military surplus, bought years ago for documenting evidence. He pressed record.

"What kind of concerns?" Aaron asked.

Vernon picked up a file folder, flipped it open. Financial records, property deeds. He set it down with deliberate care. "The fairgrounds are an active crime scene, Mr. Webb. Restricted access. Yet you've been conducting unauthorized research, removing county documents, interfering with official investigation."

"I made photocopies at the county records office. Public documents, public access."

"Documents related to an ongoing criminal investigation." Pritchard shifted uncomfortably. "That could be considered obstruction."

"Could be," Aaron agreed calmly. "But isn't. Unless you're suggesting the Eldon County Records Office is restricted, which it's not."

Vernon's expression hardened. "You're trespassing, Mr. Webb. This motel is within Ashfield town limits. The fairgrounds investigation falls under town jurisdiction. Your presence is no longer welcome."

"I've rented this room through the end of the week. Paid in full."

"The fairgrounds are closed to unauthorized personnel," Vernon said. "If you return to that property, you'll be arrested for interfering with a crime scene. If you continue gathering information related to town business, you'll be arrested for obstruction of justice. If you remain in Ashfield past tomorrow, I'll have Sheriff Pritchard escort you out of town."

Aaron met his gaze steadily. "On what charges?"

"Does it matter?" Vernon's mask dropped completely. His voice went cold, dead. "The Crowley family built Ashfield, Mr. Webb. We own the bank, the businesses, the land. We won't be destroyed by some outsider with a clipboard and delusions of righteousness. You don't understand how things work here. You never will."

"I understand perfectly," Aaron said. "I understand systematic corruption, economic control, and abuse of power. I understand seventeen women are dead and someone needs to answer for it."

Vernon stepped closer. Pritchard looked away.

"No one needs to answer for anything," Vernon said quietly. "Because nothing happened. Deaths over a century, natural causes, local burials. End of story. The only question is whether you're smart enough to accept that and leave town quietly, or whether you need to be removed forcibly."

"Removed," Aaron repeated.

"One way or another." Vernon's smile was ice. "This is your only warning, Mr. Webb. Take it."

He walked out. Pritchard followed, looking back once with something that might have been apology or warning. The door closed.

Aaron waited until he heard their vehicles leave, then stopped the recorder. Rewound it, played back the last section. Vernon's voice, clear and threatening: "The Crowley family built Ashfield... we won't be destroyed by some outsider... removed forcibly."

Documented. Evidence of intimidation, abuse of power, obstruction of justice.

Aaron made three copies of the tape immediately. One for Detective Hendricks, one for backup, one to keep on his person. If Vernon was moving this openly, this aggressively, he was desperate.

Desperate men made mistakes. But they were also dangerous.

The phone rang. Aaron answered. "Webb."

"It's Tammy." Her voice was rushed, frightened. "Emergency town council meeting. Vernon just called it. Twenty minutes from now."

"What's the agenda?"

"Public safety concerns at the fairgrounds. He's proposing emergency action to secure the excavation sites."

Aaron's stomach sank. "He's going to bulldoze the evidence."

"That's what I'm hearing. Overnight construction, backfill the holes, restore the grounds before centennial. Council's rubber-stamping it. Vote's in an hour."

"Damn it." Aaron checked his watch. Three PM. Detective Hendricks wasn't expecting them until Wednesday afternoon. Twenty-four hours too late if Vernon destroyed the burial sites tonight.

"What do we do?" Tammy asked.

"Call Jessie. Get everyone to the fairgrounds tonight. If Vernon's bringing bulldozers, we physically stop them."

"Aaron, he'll have us arrested."

"Let him. Get it on record. State police will see clear obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence. It makes our case stronger."

Silence on the line. Then: "Okay. I'll call Jessie. Be careful."

Aaron hung up, grabbed his camera. If Vernon was going to destroy evidence, Aaron would document every second.

He packed his briefcase methodically. Case files, photographs, financial records, the recorder with Vernon's threats. Everything boxed up, ready to move.

Vernon Crowley had controlled Ashfield for forty-four years. His father and grandfather before him. A century of unchecked power, economic manipulation, strategic violence.

But that control was cracking. Vernon knew it. His threats proved it.

The question was whether he'd destroy the evidence before state police could intervene.

Aaron loaded his truck. One way or another, tonight would be the turning point. Either they stopped Vernon from bulldozing the burial sites, or they watched him bury seventeen women for the second time.

Aaron's hands were steady as he drove toward the fairgrounds. Military discipline, ingrained through years of service. Assess the situation, formulate a plan, execute without hesitation.

Vernon Crowley thought he owned Ashfield. Thought he could threaten, intimidate, destroy evidence with impunity.

He was about to learn otherwise.
