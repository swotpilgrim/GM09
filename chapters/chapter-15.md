# Chapter 15: Midpoint Revelation

The state forensics press conference happened Thursday afternoon at the courthouse. Jessie watched from the back, surrounded by reporters from Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Chicago. The story had grown beyond Ashfield's ability to contain it.

Dr. Margaret Foster, chief forensic anthropologist for Iowa, stood at the podium reading from prepared remarks. "Our team has completed preliminary analysis of remains discovered at the Ashfield County Fairgrounds. We have identified seventeen individual victims, all female, aged seventeen to twenty-two at time of death. Burials span approximately one hundred years, from 1891 to 1981."

The room erupted with questions. Foster waited for silence before continuing.

"DNA analysis and dental records have provided positive identification for twelve victims. Families have been notified. The remaining five are undergoing additional testing. Cause of death in identifiable cases includes strangulation and blunt force trauma. This is now a homicide investigation coordinated with the FBI."

Jessie watched Vernon Crowley, sitting in the front row next to Sheriff Pritchard. His expression was perfectly calibrated—grief, shock, determination. The concerned mayor, devastated by this tragedy in his beloved town.

"Mr. Mayor," a reporter called out. "Do you have a statement?"

Vernon stood, turned to face the cameras. He'd worn a dark suit, tie slightly loosened, the picture of a man under strain but maintaining composure.

"This is a dark day for Ashfield," he said, voice steady. "Seventeen women—seventeen daughters of this community—murdered and buried in secret. The fairgrounds, a place that should represent joy and tradition, has become a graveyard. I want to assure everyone that I'm working closely with state and federal investigators to ensure those responsible are brought to justice, no matter how long ago these crimes occurred."

Beautiful performance. Jessie wanted to scream.

After the conference, she drove to her farm. Sheriff Pritchard's patrol car was parked in her driveway.

He was sitting on her porch, drinking coffee from a thermos. Waiting.

"Sheriff," Jessie said, climbing out of her truck. "Something I can help you with?"

"Just wanted to check in, Jessie. See how you're holding up with all this." Pritchard smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Must be stressful, finding those bodies, dealing with all the questions."

"I'm fine."

"Good, good. Because I've been hearing things. People saying you've been asking around about the Crowleys. Spending time with that safety inspector from Des Moines, the one who's supposed to be wrapping up his report but seems to still be hanging around."

Jessie kept her face neutral. "I help coordinate the fair. I've been cooperating with the investigation. That's all."

"That's good to hear." Pritchard stood, poured out his coffee. "Because you know how small-town rumors can spread. People get ideas, start making accusations without evidence. That kind of thing can damage reputations. Your family's been part of this community for generations. Hate to see that legacy tarnished by unfounded speculation."

The threat was clear. Back off or face consequences.

"I appreciate your concern, Sheriff."

"Just looking out for you, Jessie. These are dangerous times. Lot of unknowns. Safest thing is to let the professionals handle it and stay out of the way." He walked to his car, paused with his hand on the door. "Your father's bank loan—that's still with Crowley Bank, isn't it? Be a shame if there were complications."

He drove away, leaving Jessie standing in her driveway, rage and fear mixing in equal measure.

She called Aaron immediately. "Vernon knows. He's making moves."

They met at The Sunrise Cafe that evening. Tammy arrived furious, waving a piece of paper.

"Health code violation," she spat, slamming the document on the table. "Thirty years I've run that salon. Thirty goddamn years without a single citation. Now, suddenly, the state inspector finds 'inadequate sanitation procedures' and 'improper chemical storage.' It's bullshit. Complete bullshit."

"Vernon," Jessie said.

"Of course it's Vernon. He's coming after all of us."

Aaron had his own news. "My boss called this morning. Said the safety inspection contract has been terminated early, company's pulling me off the project. When I asked why, he said they'd received complaints from 'local authorities' about my professionalism."

"He's isolating us," Jessie said. "Applying pressure through channels he controls. Sheriff threatened me. Health inspector hit Tammy. Your boss pulled you. What about Wayne and Holly?"

As if on cue, Wayne walked in, looking worse than usual. Shaking hands, pale, bloodshot eyes.

"Sheriff brought me in for questioning," he said, slumping into a booth. "About 1975. About Lisa Hendricks. Someone told him I was involved. They didn't arrest me, just... questioned. Made it clear they're watching me. That if I talk to state police, they'll charge me as an accomplice."

"He's trying to discredit you," Aaron said. "Make sure your testimony looks like a coerced confession from a drunk with a grudge."

"It's working. I look like shit, I've got a criminal record—drunk and disorderly from last year—and now the sheriff has me on record as a suspect. State police won't believe me."

"They'll believe the physical evidence," Aaron insisted. "The trophy trunk, the photographs, the DNA matches. Vernon can't destroy all of that."

"Can't he?" Wayne laughed bitterly. "He's had a hundred years to perfect this system. You think he doesn't have contingencies?"

Holly hadn't shown up yet. Jessie was starting to worry when her phone rang—Holly, calling from home.

"I can't leave," Holly said, voice tight. "My parents. They got a call from Mayor Crowley today. He expressed 'concern' about me being involved in 'unfounded speculation' about the fair. Told them it was affecting my pageant performance, that maybe I should withdraw to focus on my emotional wellbeing. My parents are freaking out. They don't want me associated with anything that might make the mayor unhappy."

"Holly—"

"They're not letting me out of the house except for school and rehearsals. They think they're protecting me, but..." Holly's voice dropped to a whisper. "Jessie, I'm scared. Vernon's isolating me from you guys. What if the pageant is Saturday and I'm up there alone with no one knowing he's dangerous?"

"We're going back to Detective Chen," Jessie said. "Tomorrow. We're telling her about the pressure, the threats, everything. State police will accelerate their timeline."

"What if they don't?"

Jessie didn't have an answer.

After she hung up, she looked at the group. Wayne drinking despite it being only seven p.m. Tammy angry and scared. Aaron trying to maintain analytical calm but clearly rattled.

"He's hunting us," she said. "Vernon knows we found the evidence. Knows we went to state police. He's mobilizing everything he has to discredit us, intimidate us, isolate us before the investigation can touch him."

"The pageant is in three days," Tammy said. "If state police don't move by then—"

"He'll choose a girl," Wayne finished. "Brenda, probably. He's been watching her all week. And this time, with all the attention on the fairgrounds, he won't be able to bury her there. He'll have to improvise. Which makes him more dangerous."

Aaron spread out his notes. "We need to think like he does. Vernon's spent his entire life watching his father maintain control through intimidation and corruption. He believes in the system's invincibility. But he's also never faced this level of scrutiny before. The FBI is involved. State police have evidence. Media is everywhere."

"So what's his play?" Jessie asked.

"Delay. Discredit. Destroy. He delays investigation by pressuring us to back off. He discredits witnesses—Wayne, Holly, anyone who might testify. He destroys evidence we haven't documented yet. And if all that fails..." Aaron looked at Jessie. "He removes the threats."

"You mean kills us," Wayne said flatly.

"Not directly. Too much attention. But accidents happen. Small-town tragedies. Drunk driving, farm equipment malfunctions, house fires."

The table fell silent.

"Jesus Christ," Tammy whispered.

Jessie thought about seventeen women who'd been killed for saying no. Thought about a hundred years of murder enabled by fear and corruption. Thought about her mother, who'd worked the fair her whole life believing in its goodness.

"We can't stop now," she said. "If we back off, Vernon wins. He'll survive this investigation—his lawyers will argue insufficient evidence, claim the bodies are historic, cast doubt on chain of custody. In five years, maybe less, this will all be forgotten. And he'll kill again."

"But if we keep pushing—" Tammy started.

"We might die," Jessie finished. "I know. But seventeen women already did. And at least we'd die fighting for something that matters."

Aaron nodded slowly. "We go back to Des Moines tomorrow. Present everything to Chen—the threats, the intimidation, Vernon's pressure tactics. We argue this proves consciousness of guilt. We push for immediate arrest."

"And the pageant?" Wayne asked. "If they don't arrest him by Saturday?"

"Then we protect Holly and the other girls," Jessie said. "We don't let Vernon get any of them alone. We document everything. And if he tries something, we stop him ourselves."

"How?" Tammy demanded. "He's the mayor. He has the sheriff, the whole power structure—"

"He has institutional authority," Jessie interrupted. "But we have truth. We have evidence. We have witnesses. And we have something he doesn't."

"What?" Wayne asked.

"Nothing left to lose."

They sat in the booth, five unlikely conspirators who'd stumbled onto a century of murder and now found themselves targeted by the same system that had enabled it.

Outside, night fell on Ashfield. News vans with satellite dishes lined Main Street. Reporters interviewed townspeople. The story was spreading, growing beyond Vernon's ability to control.

But he still had power. Still had connections. Still had a century of experience in making problems disappear.

And somewhere in his Victorian mansion, Vernon Crowley was planning his next move.

The midpoint had arrived. The investigation had been discovered. The hunter had become the hunted.

What came next would determine whether justice prevailed or whether seventeen women remained just names on a list, buried and forgotten, their murders unsolved for another hundred years.

Jessie looked at her unlikely team. They were all she had. All any of them had.

It would have to be enough.
