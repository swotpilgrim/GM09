# Chapter 27: The Trial

Aaron Webb sat in the gallery of the Polk County Courthouse, watching Vernon Crowley's trial enter its third week. March 1984, six months since the arrests. The prosecution was methodical, building their case witness by witness, exhibit by exhibit.

The trial had been moved to Des Moines—impartial venue, jury pool untainted by Eldon County connections. The courtroom was packed daily. Media filled the back rows, sketch artists capturing scenes. Families of the seventeen victims sat together, united in grief and determination to see justice served.

Vernon sat at the defense table in a dark suit, clean-shaven, hair neat. Maintaining dignity. His lawyer—Richard Thornton, expensive and experienced—had crafted a defense around diminished capacity and family influence.

*Vernon Crowley was raised from birth to believe the queen tradition was his right. Brainwashed by grandfather Thomas, father Eugene. Taught that refusing Crowley men justified violence. A victim himself of generational abuse and indoctrination.*

It was a clever defense. Technically truthful—Vernon had been taught murder was acceptable. But it ignored the core truth: Vernon had embraced that teaching, expanded it, taken pride in it.

The jury wasn't buying it.

Aaron watched them during testimony—twelve Iowans, seven women and five men. They'd heard three weeks of evidence. Seen the trophy trunk, the seventeen sashes. Read Vernon's diary entries describing selection criteria, justifications, burial methods. Listened to Detective Hendricks' testimony about forensic evidence linking Vernon to both murders.

And yesterday, they'd heard Wayne Keller's recorded testimony.

Wayne had never returned. Nobody knew where he'd gone—Wyoming, maybe further. But his six hours of recorded testimony about helping Eugene dispose of Lisa Hendricks' body in 1975 had been admitted into evidence. Vernon's lawyers objected strenuously, argued hearsay and inability to cross-examine. The judge allowed it anyway—sufficient corroboration from other evidence, Wayne's credibility supported by his detailed knowledge of burial location and method.

The recording had played for the jury. Wayne's voice, halting and ashamed, describing every detail. Eugene's threats. The wrapped body. The fairgrounds excavation. Vernon's participation in covering the crime, learning the family method.

Several jurors had looked ill by the end.

The defense fought hard. Thornton painted Vernon as a tragic figure, corrupted from childhood, unable to distinguish right from wrong because his moral compass had been systematically destroyed by Thomas and Eugene.

*"Vernon Crowley committed terrible acts. We don't dispute that. But he did so believing he was fulfilling family duty, maintaining tradition. He was taught from age five that Crowley men chose fair queens, that rejection justified removal. Is that evil? Or is that the tragic result of three generations of abuse?"*

The prosecution's response was simple: Vernon was forty-four when he killed Diana Foster. He'd had decades to question, resist, choose differently. Instead, he'd embraced the tradition, refined it, documented it proudly in his diary.

Intent. Premeditation. No remorse.

Today was testimony from Ashfield witnesses. The prosecution called Tammy Sullivan first.

Tammy took the stand in a plain dress, hair pulled back. She'd been nervous before—Aaron had reminded her to breathe, to tell the truth simply.

The prosecutor, Margaret Chen, approached gently.

"Ms. Sullivan, how long have you lived in Ashfield?"

"My whole life. Forty-two years."

"Did you know the victims?"

"Some of them. Ruth Brennan was before my time, but her family are neighbors. Catherine Mills I knew personally—she'd come into my salon. Diana Foster too."

"What was the community's understanding of why these women disappeared?"

"We were told they ran away. Couldn't handle small-town life, wanted adventure. The sheriff's department never investigated seriously. Just... accepted that young women sometimes left."

"Did anyone question that narrative?"

Tammy paused. "Some people whispered. But questioning the Crowleys was dangerous. They controlled the bank, businesses, employment. You didn't ask questions if you wanted to keep your livelihood."

"So the community chose silence."

"The community chose survival."

Chen showed Tammy photographs—seventeen women, young and smiling. "These women deserved better than silence."

"Yes," Tammy said quietly. "They did."

Vernon's lawyer declined to cross-examine. Nothing Tammy said helped his case.

Next, Jessie Carter testified about discovering the trophy trunk. Described the sashes, the labels in Vernon's handwriting, the careful preservation. Vernon had kept these items like treasures, proof of his family's power and reach.

Then Aaron took the stand.

Chen walked him through his structural analysis. How each burial corresponded to fairgrounds construction projects authorized by Crowley family members. How the pattern spanned a century—Thomas, Eugene, Vernon. Three generations, seventeen murders, systematic concealment.

Thornton cross-examined aggressively.

"Mr. Webb, you're not a licensed structural engineer in Iowa, correct?"

"Correct. I'm a safety inspector."

"So your conclusions about burial patterns are speculative."

"They're based on construction records, soil analysis, and forensic evidence corroborating burial locations and timelines."

"But you can't definitively prove Vernon Crowley personally buried anyone."

"The forensic evidence does that. I just documented the pattern."

Thornton tried to poke holes, suggest alternative explanations. Aaron remained calm, factual. He'd documented truth. The evidence spoke for itself.

Holly Brennan testified as victim family representative. Spoke about her great-aunt Ruth, the twenty-two years Vera Brennan believed her sister had abandoned the family. The guilt, the grief, the wrongness of mourning someone who'd been murdered.

"My grandmother is seventy-nine years old," Holly said. "She spent most of her life angry at a murder victim. That's what the Crowley family stole—not just seventeen lives, but decades of truth from the families left behind."

Vernon watched Holly testify with no visible emotion. He'd stopped pretending remorse weeks ago.

Finally, Detective Sarah Hendricks took the stand. Lead investigator, sister of Lisa Hendricks. Chen walked her through the investigation methodically—the excavations, the DNA identifications, the forensic evidence linking Vernon to two murders directly.

Then the diary. Hendricks read excerpts aloud, Vernon's own words condemning him.

*"Chose Catherine Mills for this year's honor. Explained the opportunity. She refused. Ungrateful. Necessary to handle the situation."*

*"Diana Foster wouldn't stop asking questions. Had to be removed."*

*"Family tradition is maintained. Grandfather to father to son. This is our right."*

The courtroom was silent except for Hendricks' voice. When she finished, she looked directly at Vernon.

"Your diary documents seventeen murders spanning a century. Your handwriting is on the labels for the 1979 and 1981 victims. Forensic evidence ties you to both crime scenes. You confessed on tape. There is no reasonable doubt, Mr. Crowley. You're a serial killer who believed family legacy justified murder."

Vernon's jaw tightened but he said nothing.

The defense rested without calling Vernon to testify. Thornton had wisely kept him off the stand—Vernon's arrogance and lack of remorse would destroy any sympathy the jury might have had.

Closing arguments took a full day. Chen was devastating, systematic, walking the jury through each piece of evidence. Seventeen victims. Seventeen stories. Overwhelming proof of guilt.

Thornton did his best. Argued diminished capacity, family influence, the tragedy of generational abuse. Begged the jury to see Vernon as a victim himself, corrupted and broken by Thomas and Eugene.

The jury deliberated for four hours.

---

Aaron sat in the gallery with Jessie, Tammy, and Holly when the verdict was read. Detective Hendricks sat with her family—Lisa's mother, elderly and frail, had flown in for the trial. Families of the other victims filled the rows.

Vernon stood as the jury foreman rose.

"On the charge of first-degree murder in the death of Catherine Mills, how do you find?"

"Guilty."

Vernon's expression didn't change.

"On the charge of first-degree murder in the death of Diana Foster, how do you find?"

"Guilty."

Fifteen more counts—conspiracy to commit murder, accessory after the fact, obstruction of justice. Guilty on every charge.

When the foreman finished, the courtroom exhaled collectively. Some victims' families cried. Others sat in stunned relief.

Vernon remained standing, face impassive. He'd known this was coming. The evidence was overwhelming. But he showed no remorse, no regret. Just cold acceptance.

Sentencing came two weeks later. Same courtroom, same crowd.

Judge Patricia Martinez—appointed federal judge, impartial and experienced—read the sentence with controlled anger.

"Vernon Eugene Crowley, you have been found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, fifteen counts of conspiracy to commit murder, and multiple counts of obstruction of justice and accessory after the fact. The evidence presented at trial reveals a pattern of systematic violence spanning your entire adult life."

She paused. "You believed your family's economic power and century-long control of Eldon County made you entitled to kill women who refused to submit to you. You documented these murders in a diary with pride and arrogance. You showed no remorse during trial, no recognition of the humanity of your victims."

Vernon stood silent.

"I sentence you to life in prison without possibility of parole on each murder count, to be served consecutively. Additionally, twenty years on each conspiracy count, also consecutive. You will spend the remainder of your natural life in federal prison. You will never be released."

The gavel fell.

Vernon finally reacted—a flash of anger, quickly suppressed. "This jury has destroyed Ashfield. Without the Crowley family, that town will collapse. You've chosen seventeen dead women over a living community."

Judge Martinez's expression hardened. "This court chose justice. Ashfield will survive without the Crowley family. It will be better for it."

Marshals led Vernon away. He walked with his head up, maintaining dignity to the end. The courtroom watched him disappear through the side door—gone from Ashfield, from Iowa, from freedom forever.

---

Outside the courthouse, media surrounded the group. Aaron deflected most questions, letting Detective Hendricks handle official statements. But one reporter asked Aaron directly: "Do you feel justice was served?"

Aaron considered. "Vernon Crowley will spend the rest of his life in prison. That's justice. But seventeen women are still dead. Justice doesn't resurrect them. It just acknowledges their lives mattered, that taking them was wrong. Is that enough? No. But it's all we have."

The group walked away from the cameras together. Exhausted, relieved, aware that conviction didn't erase loss.

Jessie broke the silence. "Crowley estate is being liquidated. Assets seized, property auctioned. Proceeds go to victim compensation fund."

"How much?" Tammy asked.

"Millions. Enough that every family receives substantial payment. Not blood money this time—court-ordered restitution."

Aaron thought about the financial web he'd documented. Crowley control over Ashfield's economy. That control was ending—bank sold, grain elevator transferred, property redistributed. The family name was being erased from town institutions. First Bank of Ashfield became Heartland Community Bank. Crowley Hall at the fairgrounds was renamed Memorial Hall.

The Crowley legacy was dismantled, replaced with acknowledgment of their crimes.

Whether Ashfield could rebuild without the family that had controlled it for a century remained to be seen. But at least they'd have the chance.

Vernon Crowley was gone. Three generations of systematic murder had ended.

Justice, incomplete but real, had been served.
