# Chapter 16: The Queens Who Refused

Tammy's Beauty Barn smelled like permanent solution and AquaNet—chemical sweetness layered over years of secrets. Saturday morning light streamed through the front windows, illuminating dust motes and the faded photographs taped to the mirror: decades of clients with bouffants and feathered cuts, frozen in smiles. Tammy sat at her back office desk, surrounded by papers she'd been collecting for three days straight.

Her manual typewriter sat before her, half-finished page curled in the roller. Carbon paper underneath—she'd need copies. Lots of copies.

The desk was covered in notes: photocopied newspaper clippings, handwritten testimony from elderly women who'd sat in her chairs and finally talked, county records Aaron had duplicated for her. Seventeen names. Seventeen women who'd vanished from Ashfield between 1884 and 1981, all crowned fair queens in the months before they disappeared.

But they weren't just names anymore. Not to Tammy.

She picked up the photograph of Lorraine Fisher—1952 Fair Queen, twenty years old. According to the Ashfield Gazette archive, Lorraine had "accepted a position in Chicago" that September. According to her cousin Margaret—who'd gotten her hair done Thursday and cried through the whole appointment—Lorraine had broken up with "an important man" two weeks before she left town. Wouldn't say who. Just packed a suitcase and supposedly took the bus to Chicago.

No one ever heard from her again.

"Ungrateful girl," Margaret had said, repeating what she'd been told for thirty years. "Had everything handed to her and threw it away."

Tammy had written that down. Not because she believed it. Because it was evidence of how the town had been taught to blame the victims.

She lit a Misty 120, taking a long drag while she reviewed her notes. Every single one of the seventeen had the same story underneath the official version. Refused someone important. Got too big for their britches. Didn't know their place. The language was consistent across decades, across different families, different circumstances.

Victim-blaming dressed up as town history.

Her fingers found the typewriter keys, resuming where she'd left off:

*Ruth Brennan, 1961 Fair Queen. Age 18. Planned to attend teacher's college in Cedar Rapids. Engaged to Vernon Crowley's father, Eugene, in July. Broke engagement in August. "Moved to Chicago for opportunities" in September. Family received anonymous scholarship fund for younger siblings that fall.*

*Never contacted family again. No wedding announcements in Chicago papers. No teaching certificate issued in Illinois. No death certificate. No trace.*

*Until her bones were found beneath the fairgrounds livestock barn.*

Tammy pulled the page free, added it to the stack. Seventeen profiles, nearly complete. She was writing what the Ashfield Gazette wouldn't print—what editor Tom Preston had refused when she'd brought him the article Thursday morning.

"Can't publish speculation, Tammy," he'd said, not meeting her eyes. "Not during an active investigation. Could compromise the case."

She'd seen the fear underneath. Tom's printing press loan came from Crowley Bank. His building lease was owned by a Crowley shell company. He'd been bought decades ago, probably didn't even notice anymore.

So Tammy had taken her article to the library, paid fifteen cents, and made fifty photocopies while the librarian pretended not to watch. She'd been distributing them ever since—tucked into grocery bags at the market, handed out after church, left in stacks at the diner. Passed from hand to hand in beauty shops and living rooms across Eldon County.

The women were reading. And the women were starting to talk.

The bell above the salon door chimed. Tammy glanced up to see Doris Kleinfeld shuffling in for her weekly wash and set, her sister Helen right behind her. Both women had to be pushing eighty, pillars of the Lutheran church, keepers of Ashfield's longest memories.

"Morning, ladies." Tammy stubbed out her cigarette, slipping into her professional smile. "Right on time."

"Tammy Jo, we need to talk to you." Doris settled into the nearest chair with a heavy sigh. She clutched a worn church directory against her chest. "About those girls. The queens."

Tammy's pulse quickened, but she kept her voice casual. "What about them?"

Helen perched on the chair beside her sister. "We read your article. The one you've been passing around."

"And?"

"And you're right." Doris opened the directory, revealing folded newspaper clippings pressed between the pages like dried flowers. "We've been wrong for sixty years. Both of us. Repeating what we were told instead of asking what really happened."

Tammy pulled her rolling stool closer. "Tell me."

"Patricia Howell," Helen said quietly. "1947 Fair Queen. Friends with our older sister Mary. Beautiful girl—red hair, sang like an angel. Eugene Crowley courted her that summer. Patricia broke it off after the fair. Said he made her uncomfortable."

"Patricia was planning to move to Omaha," Doris continued. "Wanted to get away from Eugene's attention. Then one day she was just... gone. Mayor said she'd eloped with a traveling salesman. Family never talked about it."

"What did people say?" Tammy asked.

Helen's mouth thinned. "That she was a tease. Led the mayor on, then ran off with the first smooth talker who came through town. Broke a good man's heart."

"We believed it," Doris whispered. "God forgive us, we repeated that story for decades."

Tammy reached for her notepad. "Patricia Howell. 1947. Do you remember anything else? Specific dates? What she was wearing when you last saw her?"

The sisters talked for twenty minutes, remembering details that had been buried under years of accepted narrative. Tammy wrote it all down—careful, methodical, giving Patricia Howell her story back.

When they finished, she added Patricia's profile to her stack. Eighteen now. The bodies were still being excavated, the count still rising.

After Doris and Helen left—hair set, consciences eased slightly by truth-telling—Tammy returned to her desk. She pulled out the master list Aaron had created, cross-referencing dates and names. The pattern was undeniable.

Crowley man shows interest. Girl crowned queen. Girl rejects Crowley man. Girl disappears. Family receives money. Town blames girl.

Repeat for a hundred years.

The phone rang. "Tammy's Beauty Barn."

"It's Jessie. We need to meet. Holly just told me something about Ruth Brennan."

Tammy's stomach dropped. "What about her?"

"Holly's grandmother is Vera Brennan. Ruth's twin sister."

"Jesus. Does Holly know?"

"Vera just told her. Can you come to the Carter farm?"

"Twenty minutes." Tammy grabbed her purse and the Ruth Brennan file.

---

The Carter farmhouse kitchen was full of afternoon light and heavy silence. Vera Brennan sat at the table, hands wrapped around untouched coffee. Thin, weathered, strawberry-blonde hair shot through with white—the same hair as her granddaughter Holly.

Holly sat beside her, eyes red. Jessie stood by the stove, protective.

Tammy slid into the chair across from Vera. "Thank you for talking to me."

"I read your article." Vera's voice was steady, but her hands trembled. "About the girls who said no."

"Ruth said no." Vera's eyes filled. "My twin. She said no to Eugene Crowley, and I never saw her again."

Tammy opened her folder. "Can you tell me what happened?"

"We were eighteen. Identical twins. Ruth was crowned Fair Queen in July of '61. Wore that sash everywhere." A faint smile crossed her face, then crumbled.

"Eugene started courting her. Flowers, dinners in Des Moines. Ruth was flattered at first. Our parents encouraged her."

"What changed?"

"He proposed in August. Too quick. Ruth wanted to wait, go to teacher's college first. Eugene got possessive. Showed up unexpected. Made her nervous."

Holly reached for her grandmother's hand.

"Ruth broke it off. Eugene was furious—not loud, but cold. Told her she'd regret embarrassing his family. Two weeks later, Ruth told our parents she was taking the bus to Chicago. Eugene had arranged a job as a parting gift."

Vera's voice broke. "I begged her not to go. Something felt wrong. But Ruth said it was the only way to get away cleanly. She promised to write."

"Did she?"

"Never. Our parents said she was busy. Months passed. Years." Vera wiped her eyes. "Then our parents received an anonymous donation—enough for my brother's college. The church called it a blessing. I wondered if it was blood money."

"Did you suspect—"

"I didn't let myself. Because suspecting meant Ruth was dead. Murdered. I couldn't live with that. So I believed the story." She looked at Holly, anguish raw. "I was angry at her. For twenty-two years, I was angry at my murdered sister for abandoning me."

Holly wrapped her arms around Vera, both crying.

These weren't just names on a list. They were daughters. Sisters. Women whose only crime was saying no.

Tammy carefully pulled out a photograph from her file—Ruth Brennan's Fair Queen portrait, copied from the 1961 Gazette. She placed it on the table.

Vera gasped softly, touching the image with trembling fingers. "She was so beautiful. So full of dreams."

"Tell me about her dreams," Tammy said. "Tell me who she really was."

And Vera did. For an hour, she talked about Ruth—ambitious, funny, terrible at cooking but brilliant at mathematics, wanted to teach high school algebra, loved Gene Vincent records, was terrified of spiders, made everyone laugh. A real person with a real life, not just a name on a memorial list.

Tammy wrote it all down.

When Vera finished, exhausted and raw, Tammy closed her notebook. "I'm going to make sure people know who Ruth was. Not the story they told about her. The truth."

"Will it matter?" Vera asked. "She's still gone."

"It matters," Holly said quietly. "It matters to me. It'll matter to everyone who reads it."

Jessie poured fresh coffee, her jaw set. "How many others are out there? How many families carrying guilt for believing lies?"

"All of them," Tammy said. "Every victim's family was told their daughter left by choice. Told she was selfish, ungrateful, thought she was too good for Ashfield. Some of them probably still believe it."

"Then we tell them the truth." Jessie's voice was steel. "We give these women back their names and their stories. We make sure everyone knows what was really taken from them."

Tammy gathered her papers, her resolve hardening into purpose. She'd spent twenty years trading in gossip, trafficking in speculation and rumor. She'd repeated stories without questioning them, passed along judgment without examining its source.

Not anymore.

These seventeen women—eighteen, nineteen, however many they finally found—deserved more than whispers and blame. They deserved to be remembered as they really were. They deserved advocates.

She could do that. She would do that.

As she drove back to town, the sun lowering over the cornfields, Tammy thought about the article she'd write tonight. Not just facts and dates. Stories. Dreams. The women who'd worn those crowns and refused to wear chains.

The women who'd paid for their freedom with their lives.

Ashfield was going to read every word.

And this time, Tom Preston's cowardice wouldn't stop her.
