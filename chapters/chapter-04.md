# Chapter 4: The Group Forms

The back booth at The Sunrise Cafe became unofficial headquarters by unspoken agreement.

Jessie had claimed it first, then Aaron arrived with his briefcase and blueprints, and now the table was covered with papers—construction documents, Aaron's timeline, photocopied newspaper articles Tammy had dug up from somewhere. Tammy sat next to Jessie, having traded her rhinestone sweatshirt for a denim jacket, a spiral notebook full of names and dates in her looping handwriting spread before her. Holly Brennan perched at the end of the booth, looking younger than seventeen in her 4-H jacket, clutching a manila folder to her chest like it might protect her.

Wayne Keller slouched in a chair he'd pulled up to the end of the table, as far from the group as he could get while still being part of it. He'd ordered coffee but Jessie could smell the bourbon he'd added from his flask when the waitress wasn't looking.

It was eight-thirty in the evening. The cafe had emptied out except for one farmer at the counter reading the Des Moines Register. The waitress—Carol, who'd been working here since Jessie was in high school—refilled their coffee cups and left them alone, reading the tension at the table.

"Okay," Jessie said, feeling like she needed to take charge before this dissolved into chaos. "We all know something's wrong at the fairgrounds. State forensics is there. Sheriff Pritchard wants to keep it quiet. But we're already involved, whether we meant to be or not."

"I meant to be," Tammy said, flipping open her notebook. "Four women buried like trash under the place we celebrate every summer? Someone needs to figure out who they were."

"And who killed them," Aaron added, spreading his construction timeline. "These burials align perfectly with major projects overseen by the Crowley family."

Holly's eyes widened. "The Crowleys? But Mayor Crowley sponsors the 4-H scholarships. He goes to our church."

"He also signed off on construction projects where bodies were buried," Wayne said roughly. "Wake up, kid. Church doesn't make you not a monster."

Holly flinched. Jessie shot Wayne a look.

"We don't know who killed them yet," Jessie said carefully. "What we know is there's a pattern. Aaron, walk us through it."

Aaron pulled the blueprints to the center. "Main stage, 1979. Livestock barn, 1961. Grandstand, 1975. Exhibition hall, 1979. All requiring foundation excavation. Remains buried during construction, before concrete was poured. Someone with site access, timeline knowledge, and authority."

"The Crowleys owned the fairgrounds," Tammy said. "Not technically—it's town property—but they've controlled it since Thomas Crowley founded the fair in 1883. They have keys to everything, oversee every project, make every major decision."

"Did your grandfather say anything else?" Aaron asked Holly. "About the queen from 1952?"

Holly shook her head. "Just her name. Lorraine Fisher. He said my grandmother was friends with her, and Grandma never believed she just ran away." She opened her manila folder carefully, pulling out photocopied pages. "I went to the library after Grandpa left. I found the old fair programs they keep in the archives, going all the way back to the beginning."

She spread them across the table. Black and white photographs from decades past—young women in sashes and crowns, smiling for the camera. Each program had the queen's name printed underneath in elaborate script.

"Lorraine Fisher, 1952 Fair Queen," Holly read, pointing to one photo. A pretty blonde girl, eighteen maybe, wearing a white dress and holding a bouquet of summer flowers. "Crowned July 19th. There's a note in the August program that she'd moved to Chicago for a job opportunity."

"Moved, or vanished?" Tammy asked, her voice sharp.

"I looked through all of them, back to 1940," Holly continued. "A lot of the queens stayed in town, got married, had families. You can follow their whole lives through the newspaper—engagements, weddings, baby announcements. But there are gaps. Girls who just... disappear from the records after they were crowned. No wedding announcements, no obituaries, nothing. Like they just stopped existing."

She'd made a list on notebook paper, written in neat high school handwriting:

*Lorraine Fisher—1952*
*Mary Petersen—1961*
*Lisa Hendricks—1975*
*Jennifer Cole—1979*
*Barbara Yates—1947*

"Five names," Holly said quietly. "Five queens who vanished. And four of those years match the burial sites."

The table went silent.

Five young women, frozen in time. Crowns and smiles, unaware of what was coming. Five women who'd disappeared, and the town had just accepted it. Crowned new queens the next year.

"What about 1947?" Aaron asked. "Barbara Yates. No excavation at the fairgrounds that year."

"Maybe she actually left town," Tammy said, unconvinced.

"Or she's buried somewhere we haven't found yet," Wayne said, drinking his spiked coffee. "You think this is just four bodies? You think that's all?"

"What do you know, Wayne?" Jessie asked.

He met her eyes. "I know this town has secrets. I know the Crowleys run everything. I know people who ask too many questions shut up real fast." He gestured at the photographs with a shaking hand. "And I know five pretty girls don't just vanish because they wanted Chicago."

"Then help us," Aaron said.

"I don't know anything." Wayne stood abruptly. "This is Nancy Drew bullshit. The cops don't want to solve it. That's the point."

"Then we solve it anyway," Tammy said, voice steel. "Those women deserve better."

Wayne laughed bitterly. "Yeah? What happens when the Crowleys decide you know too much? When Sheriff Pritchard shows up at your house at midnight? When—" He stopped, jaw clenched. "Forget it. Get yourselves killed."

But he didn't leave. He stood there, swaying, staring at the photographs.

"Wayne, sit down," Jessie said gently.

He sat, heavily.

"Why are you here? If you think it's dangerous, why are you still here?"

Long silence. Then: "Because I'm tired of being scared."

"Okay," Jessie said finally. "Then we do this together. We figure out who these women were, what happened to them, and who's responsible. We do it quietly, we do it carefully, and we don't tell anyone we're investigating."

"The sheriff already knows we're asking questions," Aaron pointed out.

"Then we let him think we dropped it. The fair's postponed anyway. We have time to dig into records, talk to people, build a real case before we go to state authorities."

"Why not go to state police now?" Holly asked. "If we think the Crowleys are involved—"

"Because we have a pattern, not proof," Aaron said. "We have construction projects and burial sites that align chronologically. We have missing women whose names match the years. But we don't have physical evidence tying any specific person to murder. A good defense lawyer would tear this apart in five minutes."

"So we find proof," Tammy said firmly. "I can ask around, careful-like. People talk to their hairdresser. They tell me things they wouldn't tell their own mothers. Thirty years of doing hair in this town means I know where all the skeletons are buried." She paused, wincing. "Poor choice of words. But you know what I mean."

"I can research," Holly offered. "The library has newspaper archives going all the way back to the founding. I can look for more patterns, more missing women, anything about the Crowley family history that might be relevant."

"I'll go through construction and county records," Aaron said. "Map every major project at the fairgrounds since 1883, cross-reference with any missing persons reports from the state database."

They all looked at Jessie.

"I'll..." She thought about her connections in town, her family's history here, the people who'd known her since she was born. "I'll talk to the old-timers. People who remember the earlier years, who might have heard things. Carefully. Just asking about fair history, nothing that would raise alarms. I know who'll talk."

"And Wayne?" Tammy asked.

Wayne stared into his coffee cup. "I'll keep my mouth shut and try not to drink myself to death. That's about all I'm good for."

"That's not true," Holly said. Everyone looked at her. She met Wayne's eyes. "You're here. You're scared, but you're here anyway. That counts."

Wayne's expression did something complicated. For a second, Jessie saw past the anger and alcohol, saw something raw and guilty underneath.

"Yeah, well," he muttered. "We'll see."

Aaron pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and drew a grid. "We need to stay organized. Share information regularly. Meet here, maybe every other day? Compare notes, adjust our strategy as we learn more."

"Works for me," Tammy said. "I'm at the shop most days anyway. Anyone needs to reach me, just call. Number's in the phone book."

"I can't meet during school hours," Holly said. "But after three-thirty I'm free. Except for 4-H on Thursdays."

"I'll work around everyone's schedule," Aaron said. "I'm still officially here doing the safety inspection, so I have good cover for being in town asking questions."

Jessie looked at the group gathered around the table. An outsider safety inspector with military precision and an engineer's need for data. A beautician with the town's gossip network at her fingertips and thirty years of people's secrets. A high school girl who wanted to help her dead great-aunt and believed in doing the right thing. An alcoholic demolition derby organizer who knew something he wasn't saying and was terrified of what might happen if he did. And herself—local farmer's daughter, fair coordinator, trying to hold this unlikely team together.

They weren't detectives. They weren't qualified for this kind of investigation. They were just ordinary people who'd stumbled onto something horrible and couldn't look away.

But they were all they had.

"Okay," she said. "We do this. For them." She touched one of the photographs—Lorraine Fisher, smiling for the camera in 1952, eighteen years old and completely unaware she'd end up bones buried in the ground beneath a stage. "For all of them."

"For all of them," Tammy echoed, her voice firm.

Holly nodded, determined despite her obvious fear.

Aaron made a note in his precise engineering script.

Wayne just sat there, staring at the photographs of the dead queens like they were ghosts come back to haunt him.

Outside, Ashfield settled into its quiet evening rhythms. Lights went off in shops along Main Street. Families went to bed in houses where the doors still went unlocked. The fairgrounds sat empty and dark at the edge of town, police tape fluttering in the night breeze over earth that had given up its secrets.

And five unlikely investigators finished their coffee and committed, each for their own complicated reasons, to uncovering a truth that had been buried beneath celebrations and tradition for decades.

Whether or not that truth would get them killed remained to be seen.
