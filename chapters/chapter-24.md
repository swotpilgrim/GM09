# Chapter 24: The Confession

Detective Sarah Hendricks sat in the observation room at Iowa State Police Regional Headquarters, watching Vernon Crowley through two-way glass. Orange jumpsuit, handcuffs, lawyer in expensive suit whispering strategies that wouldn't matter anymore.

Two weeks since his arrest. Two weeks of legal maneuvering, motions to suppress evidence, claims of innocence. Vernon's defense: he'd never killed anyone. The trophies belonged to his father Eugene. He'd preserved them as evidence, planning to report Eugene's crimes.

A lie. But plausible enough his lawyers could sell it.

Until this morning.

Sarah looked at the leather-bound book on the table before her. Vernon Eugene Crowley's personal diary, discovered during secondary search of his mansion study. Hidden in a locked desk drawer, false bottom beneath mayoral correspondence.

Forty years of entries. Meticulous handwriting. Dated, detailed, damning.

She opened to a page marked with evidence tape. September 12, 1979.

*Chose Catherine Mills for this year's honor. Beautiful girl, eighteen, farm family. Crowned her myself at the centennial pageant. Felt the tradition continuing—grandfather to father to son. The Crowley legacy maintained.*

*Invited Catherine to dinner at the estate. Explained the opportunity—position with the family, financial security, recognition. She'd be under Crowley protection, guided and cared for. A privilege.*

*She refused. Said she had plans for college, didn't need my help. Ungrateful. Disrespectful. After everything the Crowley family has done for this town, she threw opportunity back in my face.*

*Father taught me: some women don't understand honor. They reject what they should embrace. When that happens, action is required. Protect the family legacy. Maintain order.*

*October 8, 1979. Followed Catherine home from volunteer work at the library. Quiet road, no witnesses. Explained one final time what refusing meant. She threatened to report me for harassment. Called me entitled, said I had no right to her.*

*Strangled her. Took six minutes. She fought. But the family tradition is stronger than one girl's defiance.*

*Buried her under the new restroom foundation, construction scheduled for next week. Father's method works well. Fairgrounds belong to the Crowleys. Our land. Our tradition. Our right.*

Sarah's hands clenched on the diary. Clinical language, calm descriptions. Vernon wrote about murder like crop yields.

She turned pages. 1981. Another girl. Another refusal. Another burial.

*Diana Foster wouldn't stop asking questions about Catherine. Said something felt wrong, wanted to talk to state police. Couldn't allow that. Family reputation depends on discretion.*

*Blunt force. Quicker than strangulation. Less struggle. Buried near the livestock barn renovation.*

Forty years. Seventeen victims mentioned. Details about his father Eugene's murders—participated in covering some, learned the method, inherited the tradition.

And justifications. Page after page of entitled reasoning. The Crowley family built Ashfield. They owned the fair. Choosing the queen was their right. If queens refused, removal was necessary. Not murder. Correction. Maintaining order.

Sarah closed the diary, breathed slowly. Professional detachment. This was evidence, not personal.

Except Lisa was her sister. And Vernon's 1975 entry described Eugene strangling an "uppity college girl who refused Vernon's courtship." Sarah had read that entry three times, hands shaking. Vernon hadn't killed Lisa himself—that was Eugene—but he'd known. Helped cover it up. Accepted it as family tradition.

*Some girls don't understand their place.*

Lisa had understood her place perfectly. Veterinary school. Independence. A future that didn't include Crowley control.

And she'd been murdered for it.

Sarah stood, picked up the diary, and walked into the interrogation room.

Vernon looked up when she entered. His lawyer, Richard Thornton, straightened.

"Detective Hendricks. My client has already stated—"

"I'm not here to question him." Sarah set the diary on the table between them. "I'm here to show him what we found."

Vernon's expression didn't change. But his eyes fixed on the book, and something flickered—recognition, fear.

"What's that?" Thornton asked.

"Your client's personal diary. Discovered this morning during lawful search of his residence. Forty years of entries detailing the selection, stalking, murder, and burial of seventeen women." Sarah opened to the 1979 entry. "Would you like me to read excerpts, or review it privately with your client?"

Thornton reached for the diary. Sarah pulled it back.

"This is evidence. You'll receive copies through discovery. But right now, I want Mr. Crowley to understand his legal strategy just collapsed."

She turned pages, reading aloud. Vernon's descriptions of choosing victims. His justifications. His step-by-step accounts of murder—methods, burial locations, rationalizations.

Thornton went pale. "Detective, I need to confer with my client—"

"Your client documented seventeen murders in meticulous detail." Sarah's voice was controlled. But her eyes met Vernon's. "He described strangling Catherine Mills for refusing dinner. Killing Diana Foster for asking questions. Covering up his father's murder of my sister Lisa because 'family tradition matters more than individual lives.'"

Vernon's mask cracked. Not guilt. Anger.

"You don't understand," he said quietly.

"Vernon, don't say anything—"

"She doesn't understand what the Crowley family built. What we've maintained for a hundred years." Vernon leaned forward, handcuffs rattling. "We own Ashfield. We created it. The bank, the businesses, the fairgrounds. Everything that matters here exists because of Crowley money and Crowley vision."

"Mr. Crowley, as your attorney I strongly advise—"

"The fair queen tradition belongs to us. We choose the worthiest girl each year. We offer her honor, position, protection." Vernon's voice was rising, righteous indignation replacing fear. "If she accepts, she receives everything. If she refuses... she rejects the family that built this town. That's betrayal. That requires correction."

Sarah activated the recording equipment deliberately. Red light blinking. "You're confessing to murder, Mr. Crowley."

"I'm explaining family responsibility." Vernon's eyes were cold, certain. "My grandfather taught my father. My father taught me. The Crowley family built Ashfield, and maintaining order is our duty. When women refuse to understand that, when they reject opportunities and threaten to expose family business, action is necessary."

"Action," Sarah repeated. "You mean murder."

"I mean protecting what we built. The seventeen women memorialized in that diary—every one of them refused to honor the family. Rejected gratitude, threatened exposure, acted entitled to futures they hadn't earned. They needed to be removed."

Thornton was frantically trying to interrupt. Vernon ignored him.

"Catherine Mills. I offered her everything—financial security, position, recognition. She said no. Said she had college plans, didn't need my help. After my family paid for half the town's infrastructure, employed her father at the grain elevator for thirty years, she acted like I had no right to expect gratitude."

"So you killed her."

"So I corrected the situation." Vernon's voice went flat. "Followed her home, explained consequences, gave her one final chance. She threatened to report me. Said I was entitled, obsessed, dangerous. She didn't understand. The Crowley family isn't dangerous. We're necessary. We maintain order. When order is threatened, we act."

"Diana Foster?"

"Wouldn't stop asking questions about Catherine. Two years later, still investigating, talking about going to state police. I couldn't allow that. Family reputation depends on discretion."

"So you killed her too."

"Protected the family legacy." Vernon leaned back, arrogant despite handcuffs. "My father did the same. His father before him. Seventeen women over a hundred years—every one a threat to what we built. Every one removed to protect Ashfield's stability."

Sarah's jaw clenched. "Lisa Hendricks was my sister."

Vernon blinked. "Your sister?"

"1975. Eugene strangled her for refusing your courtship. You documented it. You participated in the cover-up. You accepted her murder as family tradition."

Something shifted in Vernon's expression—not remorse, but recognition of error. "I didn't kill Lisa. That was my father."

"But you knew. You helped. You kept her sash as a trophy." Sarah's control was ice-thin. "My sister wanted to be a veterinarian. She was eighteen years old. And your father murdered her because she said no to you."

"She embarrassed me publicly," Vernon said, defensive. "Rejected me at the fair dance in front of half the town. My father said that kind of disrespect couldn't stand. Said I needed to learn how to handle difficult women."

"So he strangled her."

"So he taught me family responsibility." Vernon's voice went cold again. "And I learned. 1979, 1981—I handled it myself. No hesitation. Clean, efficient. The method my father taught me, passed down from my grandfather. That's tradition. That's legacy."

Thornton finally gave up. Set down his pen, slumped in his chair. His client had confessed to multiple murders on tape.

Sarah turned off the recording. Stood. "Vernon Eugene Crowley, you're being charged with two counts of first-degree murder, multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder, and accessory after the fact to fifteen additional homicides. Your arraignment is tomorrow."

"You're destroying Ashfield," Vernon said. "The Crowley family built this town. Without us, it collapses. Businesses close, jobs disappear, the whole economy craters. Is that what you want? Economic devastation for the satisfaction of prosecuting family traditions you don't understand?"

"I understand perfectly." Sarah picked up the diary. "You're a serial killer who believed entitlement justified murder. Your family tradition is violence against women who refused to obey you. And Ashfield will survive without the Crowleys. It'll be better for it."

She walked out of the interrogation room, closed the door, and stood in the corridor breathing slowly.

Professional detachment. She'd maintained it through Vernon's confession, his justifications, his cold descriptions of choosing victims and burying them under fairgrounds she'd walked as a child.

But Lisa had been her sister. Eighteen years old, bright, ambitious, murdered for saying no to a man who believed his family's money made him entitled to her.

And Vernon showed no remorse. None. Just pride in maintaining tradition, anger at being questioned, arrogance even in handcuffs.

Sarah had spent eight years in cold cases, hunting for evidence, hoping Lisa had run away. Now she knew the truth—strangled and buried under a barn floor because Eugene Crowley needed to teach his son "how to handle difficult women."

She wanted to go back into that interrogation room and—

No. Professional detachment. Justice through the legal system. Conviction, sentencing, prison.

Vernon would stand trial. The diary provided overwhelming evidence—seventeen murders documented in his own handwriting. His recorded confession sealed it. No jury would acquit.

He'd spend the rest of his life in prison. And the Crowley family dynasty would be dismantled, erased from Ashfield's institutions, remembered only as a century of systematic murder enabled by economic control and community complicity.

That was justice.

It didn't bring Lisa back. Didn't erase eight years of wondering. Didn't heal the wound of knowing her sister had been murdered for refusing a dance.

But it was all Sarah could give her.

She returned to the observation room, filed the diary with other evidence, and began preparing prosecution documents. Seventeen counts. Forty years of documentation. A confession, recorded and irrefutable.

Vernon Crowley had believed his family's legacy made him untouchable.

He was about to learn otherwise.
