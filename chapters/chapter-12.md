# Chapter 12: Wayne's Secret

Wayne's trailer sat at the end of a gravel road three miles outside town. Single-wide, rust-stained, tarp over the leaking roof. The kind of place people drove past without seeing—rural poverty made visible.

Sunday morning. Wayne had been drinking since last night. Jim Beam on the coffee table, half-empty.

He heard vehicles pull up outside. Doors slamming. Footsteps on the rickety porch.

Jessie didn't knock, just opened the door and walked in. Tammy followed.

Wayne looked up from the couch. "It's rude to break into someone's home."

"Door was unlocked," Jessie said, surveying the disaster. Empty bottles everywhere, overflowing ashtray, clothes in piles. The smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke hung thick. "Jesus, Wayne."

"Get out."

"No. We need to talk." Tammy closed the door.

"I said everything."

"You didn't say anything." Jessie moved bottles, sat. "You ran. Like you've been running for eight years. It stops now."

Wayne laughed bitterly. "You don't know what you're asking."

"We know you helped Eugene Crowley bury Lisa Hendricks in 1975," Tammy said. "We know you were seventeen. We know he paid you. We know he threatened you. What we don't know is the details. And we need them, Wayne. Not for prosecution—for understanding."

"Why? You got your evidence. Got your trophy trunk. Take it to state police and leave me alone."

Jessie leaned forward. "Because we're walking into a fight with the most powerful family in Eldon County. Because we need to understand exactly how they operate, how they control people, how they've gotten away with this for a hundred years. You're the only living witness we have."

"I'm not a witness. I'm an accomplice."

"You were a kid who was threatened and coerced."

"I was old enough to know right from wrong."

The argument hung in the air. Wayne reached for the Jim Beam, but Tammy moved faster, snatching the bottle off the table.

"Hey—"

"Coffee first." She walked to the kitchen, found the Mr. Coffee machine under a pile of dishes. "You're going to sober up, and you're going to tell us what happened. Then you can drink yourself to death if that's what you want. But not before."

Wayne slumped back. He could throw them out. Should. But part of him—the part carrying this weight for eight years—was tired of running.

Tammy made coffee. Strong, black, no sugar. She poured three mugs, handed one to Wayne.

"Drink."

He drank. It was awful, bitter, scalding hot. He drank anyway.

They sat in silence for ten minutes while Wayne worked through two cups. The caffeine cut through the alcohol fog slightly. Not enough to make him feel better, just enough to make everything sharper, clearer.

"It was August 1975," he said finally. Voice rough. "I was seventeen. Working summer construction for my uncle's concrete company. Family business was failing—farm equipment dealership, couldn't compete with the chains. We were gonna lose everything."

Jessie and Tammy waited, didn't interrupt.

"Eugene Crowley showed up at a job site. Pulled me aside. Said he had a special project, needed someone strong and discrete. Fifty dollars cash for a night's work. Fifty dollars was more than I made in a week. I said yes before I even knew what it was."

Wayne stared into his coffee mug, seeing that night again. Always seeing it.

"He told me to meet him at the fairgrounds at midnight. Bring a shovel. I thought maybe it was fixing drainage, something boring. I showed up and..." He stopped, hands shaking. "His truck was there. Barn lights on. I went inside and there was a body wrapped in canvas on the floor."

"Lisa Hendricks," Tammy said quietly.

"I didn't know her name then. Eugene said, 'We're burying this tonight. Grandstand foundation pour is tomorrow morning. No one will ever find her.' Just like that. Matter-of-fact. Like he was giving instructions for mixing concrete."

"Did you see her?" Jessie asked. "The body?"

"Just... part of her hand. The canvas wasn't wrapped tight enough at one end. I saw her hand. White, dead. Nail polish. Pink nail polish." Wayne's voice cracked. "She'd painted her nails and then someone killed her."

Tammy set down her coffee mug, eyes wet.

"Eugene said if I helped, fifty dollars cash and we'd never speak of it again. If I refused, if I told anyone, he'd destroy my family's business and make sure I went to prison as an accomplice. He said he had connections. Sheriff, judge, everyone. I'd hang for this either way, but at least if I helped, my family survived."

"You were seventeen," Jessie repeated. "A kid being threatened by the mayor."

"I dug the grave." Wayne looked at his hands. Thirty-three years old, but in his mind he was still seventeen, holding a shovel in the dark. "We drove to the grandstand site. I dug while Eugene watched. Six feet down. He helped me lower her in. She was wrapped tight, but she was heavy. Dead weight. We got her in the grave, I filled it back up. By the time we finished it was three in the morning."

"What did Eugene say?" Tammy asked. "During all this?"

"He talked. The whole time, he talked. Calm, conversational. Said she'd gotten ideas above her station. Thought she was too good for Ashfield, too good for what he was offering her. Crowley men don't get told no—that's what he said. Exactly that. 'Crowley men don't get told no.'"

The phrase landed heavy in the small trailer.

"He talked about his father, Thomas. Said Thomas taught him how it worked. Choose the pretty ones, offer them opportunities, if they accept, everyone benefits. If they refuse..." Wayne gestured vaguely. "Thomas handled seven. Eugene said he'd done nine by that point. Talked about it like it was tradition. Family legacy."

"Jesus Christ," Jessie whispered.

"He paid me the fifty dollars when we finished. Told me to go home, forget this happened, and if I ever mentioned it to anyone, the Crowleys would know. They always know. Then he drove away and I stood there in the dark covered in dirt from burying a girl I'd never met."

Wayne drained his coffee. "I didn't tell anyone. Didn't go to police. Didn't even tell my parents. I just... kept working. Construction season ended, I went back to school for senior year, graduated, got a job. Kept my mouth shut. Watched Eugene Crowley at church, at town meetings, at the county fair every summer. Watching him smile and shake hands and run for reelection while I knew exactly what he'd done."

"What about your family?" Tammy asked. "Did the business survive?"

"For two more years. Then it went under anyway, 1977. Turns out Eugene's threat was bullshit—he didn't need to destroy us, the economy did it for him. Dad sold everything, moved to Cedar Rapids, got a factory job. Died of a heart attack in 1980." Wayne's laugh was bitter. "I kept quiet to save a business that failed anyway and protect a man who worked himself to death."

"Vernon," Jessie said. "Did you ever see him involved?"

"Not directly. But Eugene mentioned him once while we were burying her. Said, 'My son will understand this someday. When he's older, when he's ready, I'll teach him like my father taught me.' Talking about passing down murder like a family recipe."

The room fell silent except for the drip of the leaky roof into a bucket in the corner.

"I've been drinking since 1976," Wayne said. "Started slow, got worse. Couldn't hold a regular job. Ended up doing demolition derby because it was the only thing where destroying things felt right. Every time I get in that arena and smash cars into each other, I'm thinking about Eugene Crowley. About digging that grave. About how I could have said no, could have gone to police, could have done something."

"You were seventeen," Jessie said for the third time. "You were terrorized."

"Doesn't make the girl any less dead."

Tammy reached across the space between them, put her hand on Wayne's arm. "What you did was wrong. Helping bury her, keeping quiet—that was wrong. But you were a victim too. Different kind, but still a victim. Eugene Crowley chose you because you were vulnerable, young, desperate. He knew exactly what he was doing."

"Doesn't absolve me."

"No. But it means you get to choose what happens next. You can keep drinking, keep hating yourself, keep running from this. Or you can testify. Tell state police exactly what you told us. Help make sure Vernon doesn't kill again."

"I'll go to prison."

"Maybe," Jessie said honestly. "Or maybe the prosecutors will see you as a coerced minor witness and offer immunity for testimony. Either way, you'll have done the right thing. Finally."

Wayne thought about Lisa Hendricks. About her pink nail polish. About how she'd gotten ready for something—a date, maybe, or just a normal day—and ended up dead in a canvas sheet, buried under concrete.

He thought about seventeen other women. Seventeen girls who'd said no to the wrong man.

He thought about eight years of drinking himself stupid, trying to forget something that would never go away.

"Okay," he said finally. Voice barely above a whisper. "I'll testify. Tell them everything."

Tammy squeezed his arm. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. This doesn't make me a good person."

"No," Jessie agreed. "But it makes you better than you were yesterday."

They sat in the trailer for another hour. Wayne gave them details—exact location of the grave, timeline of that night, everything Eugene had said. Jessie took notes in careful handwriting, creating a statement that could be used by investigators.

When they finally left, Wayne sat alone surrounded by empty bottles and the ghosts of his choices.

He looked at the Jim Beam on the counter where Tammy had set it.

Then he poured it down the sink.

It didn't make him feel better. Didn't wash away eight years of guilt. But it was something.

A start.

Outside, the Iowa sun rose higher, burning off morning fog. Sunday service at the First Methodist Church would start in an hour. Mayor Vernon Crowley would be in his usual pew, second row, singing hymns and shaking hands afterward.

And tomorrow, Wayne would tell state police about the night Eugene Crowley taught him how to bury a body.
