# Chapter 29: The Fair's Future

The Ashfield High School gymnasium was packed on a humid June evening, folding chairs arranged in rows, standing room only along the walls. Nearly three hundred people had showed up for the town meeting—more than had attended in a decade.

The question on everyone's mind: should the Eldon County Fair continue?

Jessie Carter sat in the third row, watching the debate unfold. Ten months since Vernon's conviction. Ten months since the Crowley dynasty collapsed. Ten months of Ashfield trying to figure out who it was without the family that had controlled it for a century.

The fair was the focal point of that identity crisis.

Mayor Pro Tem David Harrison—elected after Vernon's arrest, farmer with no Crowley connections—stood at a podium trying to maintain order. "We're here to decide the future of our county fair. This is a community decision. Everyone gets a say."

The gymnasium erupted. People shouting, hands raised, voices overlapping.

Harrison banged a gavel. "One at a time! Tom, you have the floor."

Tom Preston, Ashfield Gazette editor, stood. He'd aged ten years in the past twelve months. "Cancel it. Permanently. The fair is tainted beyond repair. Seventeen women were murdered there over a century. Every building, every structure is a burial site. How can we ask families to celebrate where their daughters were buried?"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through half the crowd. Lorraine Fisher's daughter nodded. Ruth Brennan's family sat together, silent.

"Canceling erases a hundred years of legitimate tradition," countered Margaret Sullivan, Tammy's aunt. "The fair isn't the problem—the Crowleys were. We've removed them. Demolished their structures. Why should we lose our heritage because three men corrupted it?"

More voices. Arguments cascading over each other.

"It's a crime scene!"

"It's our community gathering!"

"How can we pretend it's normal?"

"How can we let murderers destroy what they don't own?"

Harrison banged the gavel again. "Jessie Carter requested time to present a proposal. Jessie?"

Jessie stood, throat tight. She'd prepared notes but left them in her pocket. This needed to come from the heart.

"The Eldon County Fair has been part of Ashfield for a hundred years," she began. "It's where we showcase livestock, celebrate harvest, bring the community together. That tradition is real. It matters. But so does the truth about what happened there."

She looked around the gymnasium. Familiar faces—neighbors, friends, people she'd known her whole life.

"The Crowleys used the fair as a hunting ground. They murdered seventeen women and buried them under structures they controlled. That's horror. That's evil. But it's also history we can't erase by canceling the fair. If we do that, we're still letting the Crowleys control us. Still letting their crimes define our community."

Silence. People listening.

"I propose we reclaim the fair. Not pretend the murders didn't happen, but acknowledge them. Transform the fairgrounds from a hunting ground into a memorial. Abolish the beauty pageant that gave the Crowleys their victims. Redesign the space to honor the seventeen women. And use the fair as education—teach future generations what happened, how systems of power enabled violence, how communities can choose accountability over silence."

She sat down. The gymnasium stayed quiet for a long moment.

Then Aaron Webb stood. He'd driven from Des Moines for this meeting. "I'm a structural engineer. I can provide redesign plans. Demolish the old main stage where queens were crowned. Build a memorial garden in its place. Native Iowa plants, benches bearing victims' names. Transform the physical space to reflect acknowledgment rather than denial."

Tammy Sullivan stood next. "And we abolish the beauty pageant. Permanently. No more queens. No more competitions judging teenage girls on appearance. That tradition is what gave the Crowleys access to victims. It needs to end."

"But the pageant is tradition!" someone protested. "My grandmother was fair queen. My mother. It's been part of this community for generations."

"So was murder," Tammy shot back. Her voice was sharp, angry. "Seventeen generations of Crowley men choosing victims from pageant winners. You want to continue that tradition? Dress it up, call it heritage, and hope the next batch of girls stays safe? I won't. My daughter won't participate. No girl in this town should be judged and displayed like that ever again."

The gymnasium erupted again. Half supporting Tammy, half defending the pageant as harmless tradition.

Holly Brennan stood, young and steady. "What if we created a different tradition? Not beauty pageant. Service recognition. Choose one person—any age, any gender—based on community service and victim advocacy. Honor them not for appearance but for what they've contributed. We could call it the Seventeen Memorial Tribute. Remember the victims while celebrating people who make Ashfield better."

Murmurs. People considering.

"That could work," someone said.

"It's not the same as a pageant."

"That's the point," Holly replied.

Harrison let the discussion continue. Arguments, proposals, passionate speeches from both sides. Some wanted the fair canceled entirely—too much pain, too many associations. Others wanted it preserved exactly as it was—changing things meant the Crowleys won.

But slowly, a middle ground emerged. Transform the fair. Acknowledge the horror. Honor the victims. Reclaim the celebration.

After two hours of debate, Harrison called for a vote.

"All in favor of continuing the Eldon County Fair with the proposed changes—memorial garden, abolished beauty pageant, educational exhibits, and Seventeen Memorial Tribute recognition—raise your hand."

Jessie raised hers. Aaron, Tammy, Holly. Most of the gymnasium.

"Opposed?"

Fewer hands. Families of some victims, people who couldn't separate the fair from the crimes.

Harrison counted. "Motion passes. The Eldon County Fair will continue, fundamentally transformed."

Applause. Not jubilant—too solemn for that. But relieved. A decision made. A path forward chosen.

---

Over the following months, Ashfield rebuilt.

The old main stage came down in July. Bulldozers demolished the structure where a hundred years of fair queens had been crowned. Jessie watched the demolition with mixed feelings—satisfaction at erasing the Crowley symbol, sadness at losing a landmark.

But what replaced it was beautiful.

Aaron's design was simple, elegant. Circular memorial garden, seventeen wooden benches arranged around a central fountain. Each bench bore a carved name and dates. Native Iowa prairie flowers—black-eyed Susans, purple coneflowers, wild bergamot—planted throughout. A place for reflection, remembrance, peace.

The fountain's centerpiece was Iowa limestone, engraved with all seventeen names. Water flowed constantly, gentle and soothing.

Tammy organized fundraising for a domestic violence shelter. The shelter would be named the Seventeen Memorial Center, offering resources for abuse survivors—counseling, legal aid, emergency housing. Fair revenue would fund it annually.

"We can't bring them back," Tammy said at a planning meeting. "But we can make sure their deaths meant something. Make sure future women have protection the seventeen didn't."

The shelter opened in August—a converted house on Main Street, staffed by volunteers, funded by community donations. Small but significant. A tangible response to systematic violence.

The fair committee redesigned the event entirely. No beauty pageant. Instead, the Seventeen Memorial Tribute—one person chosen annually for community service and victim advocacy. The first tribute recipient would be Holly Brennan, selected for her work organizing the memorial and raising awareness about the murders.

Educational exhibits replaced entertainment stages. Displays about domestic violence prevention, community accountability, the history of the Crowley crimes. Not sensational—respectful, educational, honest.

And the theme for the rescheduled centennial fair: "Reclaiming Our Heritage, Honoring the Lost."

Not everyone supported the changes. Some families left Ashfield entirely, unable to separate the town from the horror. Some fairgrounds vendors refused to return, association too painful. Attendance would likely be lower than past years.

But the fair would happen. Transformed, acknowledged, accountable.

September 1984, the planning committee met for final preparations. Jessie, Aaron, Tammy, Holly, and a dozen other community members gathered in the town hall conference room. Architectural drawings spread across tables, vendor contracts stacked in folders.

"Memorial garden is complete," Aaron reported. "Benches installed, fountain operational, flowers blooming. It's ready."

"Tribute ceremony is scheduled for opening night," Holly added. "I've prepared remarks about service and remembrance."

"Domestic violence shelter is staffed and open," Tammy said. "We've already had three women use our services. The need is real."

Harrison reviewed vendor confirmations. "Livestock exhibits are full. Food vendors committed. Educational displays finalized. We're good to go."

Jessie looked at the documents. A year ago, Ashfield had been fractured—divided between people who wanted truth and people who wanted comfort. The debate over the fair's future had forced the community to choose.

They'd chosen accountability. Difficult, painful, necessary accountability.

"Any final concerns?" Harrison asked.

Silence. Then Margaret Sullivan spoke. "My niece was vandalized during the investigation. My business nearly closed when Crowley money dried up. This past year was hell. But I'm proud of what we're doing. Ashfield is better for facing the truth."

Murmurs of agreement.

"The seventeen women deserved this years ago," said Ruth Brennan's cousin. "They deserve to be remembered as people, not scandals. The memorial does that. Thank you for making it happen."

Jessie felt emotion tighten her throat. A year of town meetings, debates, construction, fundraising. A year of Ashfield wrestling with its identity and choosing to be better than its founders.

The Crowley dynasty was gone. Erased from street names, building plaques, bank titles. First Bank of Ashfield had become Heartland Community Bank. Crowley Hall was now Memorial Hall. The family name appeared only in court records and memorial inscriptions.

And the fair—once the Crowleys' personal hunting ground—was now a space of remembrance, education, accountability.

Vernon had been wrong. Ashfield hadn't collapsed without the Crowley family. It had survived. Changed. Grown.

"Fair opens in two weeks," Harrison said. "Let's make it something the seventeen women would've wanted. A community that remembers, learns, and protects its most vulnerable."

The committee agreed.

---

Jessie drove home through September evening, golden light across harvested fields. The fairgrounds stood in the distance, transformed. No more Crowley control. No more beauty pageant. No more silence.

Just memory, accountability, and cautious hope for a community trying to be better than its past.

The Eldon County Fair would open in two weeks. Different. Smaller. More honest.

And seventeen women would finally be honored not as victims or scandals, but as people whose lives had mattered, whose deaths demanded acknowledgment, whose memory required truth.

Ashfield had made its choice.

To remember.
