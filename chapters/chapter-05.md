# Chapter 5: The Missing Queen

Holly's grandparents lived three miles outside Ashfield on a dairy farm that had been in the Brennan family for four generations. The farmhouse was white clapboard with green shutters, surrounded by ancient oak trees that had been there longer than the house itself. Holstein cows grazed in the pastures, black and white against the green grass.

Holly pulled her bicycle into the gravel driveway Tuesday morning before school. She'd woken up early, unable to stop thinking about the meeting last night, about those photographs of the dead queens. About her grandmother's friend Lorraine Fisher, who'd been crowned in 1952 and disappeared that same year.

The kitchen smelled like coffee and bacon. Grandma Vera stood at the stove, her silver hair in its usual neat bun, wearing a flowered housedress and an apron. She turned when Holly came in, surprise crossing her lined face.

"Holly? What are you doing here so early? Is something wrong?"

"No, Grandma. I just..." Holly set her backpack down. "I wanted to talk to you about something. About when you were young."

Vera's expression shifted, became careful. "Your grandfather's out in the barn. Let me pour you some coffee."

"I don't drink coffee."

"You do today." Vera filled two mugs, added cream and sugar to both without asking, and sat down at the kitchen table. "Sit."

Holly sat. The coffee was too hot and too sweet, but she wrapped her hands around the mug anyway.

"They found bodies at the fairgrounds," Holly said. "The police. State forensics. Four bodies buried under the buildings."

Vera's hand trembled slightly as she raised her mug. "I heard."

"Women. Young women. Buried during construction projects. One from 1952."

The mug came down slowly, set precisely on the table. Vera stared at the surface of her coffee like she could read the future in it.

"Grandma, Grandpa mentioned Lorraine Fisher yesterday. He said she was your friend. He said she was crowned queen in 1952 and everyone thought she ran away to Chicago, but you never believed it."

"I didn't say that to your grandfather," Vera said quietly. "Not out loud. Not in all these years."

"But it's true?"

Long silence. Outside, a rooster crowed. The refrigerator hummed. Vera's hands tightened around her mug until her knuckles went white.

"Lorraine was my best friend," she said finally. "We grew up together. Same school, same church, same everything. We were both eighteen that summer. She was beautiful—blonde hair, blue eyes, smile that could light up a room. I was the plain one. I knew she'd win the pageant. I was happy for her when she did."

Holly waited.

"She was crowned July 19th. I remember because it was my birthday too—we shared the same birthday, both born July 19th, 1934. The pageant was in the evening, and afterward there was a dance. Mayor Eugene Crowley—Vernon's father—he was there. He danced with Lorraine. He was... attentive. Too attentive. She told me later he made her uncomfortable."

"What happened?"

"Over the next few weeks, he kept finding reasons to be around her. Offering her a job at the town clerk's office. Inviting her to dinner with his family. Showing up at her parents' farm. Lorraine was polite, but she wasn't interested. She had a boyfriend—Danny Meyers, nice boy from the next county. They were planning to get married, save up for their own place."

Vera's voice had gone distant, remembering.

"In early September, Lorraine told me Eugene had offered her a job in Chicago. Secretary position, good pay, he'd make the arrangements. She laughed about it. Said it was ridiculous—she didn't want to go to Chicago, she wanted to marry Danny and stay in Iowa. She was going to tell Eugene no the next time she saw him."

"And then she disappeared?"

"September 8th. She went to town to run errands. Never came home. Her parents were frantic. They called the sheriff, organized search parties, put up flyers. After two weeks, Eugene Crowley told them he'd received a letter from Lorraine. She'd taken the Chicago job after all, wanted to apologize for leaving without saying goodbye, needed space to find herself."

"Did you see the letter?"

"No one did except Eugene and the sheriff. Lorraine's parents wanted to believe she was safe, that she'd write to them directly soon. Months went by. No letter. But Eugene kept assuring everyone she was fine, just needed time. Eventually people stopped asking. The following summer, they crowned a new queen. Life went on."

Holly felt cold despite the warm kitchen. "You knew something was wrong."

"I knew Lorraine would never leave like that. Never leave Danny without a word. Never abandon her parents. She wasn't that kind of person." Vera looked at Holly directly for the first time. "But I was eighteen years old in a town where the Crowley family owned everything. My father told me to stop asking questions. Said it wasn't safe. So I stopped. I got married to your grandfather two years later, had your mother, lived my whole life here. And I never stopped feeling guilty that I didn't fight harder for my friend."

Tears tracked down Vera's weathered cheeks.

Holly reached across the table and took her grandmother's hand. "Grandma, they're identifying the bodies now. If one of them is Lorraine—"

"It is," Vera said with certainty. "I've known for sixty-one years where my best friend was buried. Right there at the fairgrounds where we used to go every summer. Right there under the stage where she was crowned."

"How did you know?"

"Because I saw Eugene Crowley the morning after she disappeared. Driving past our farm in his truck at dawn, coming from the direction of the fairgrounds. His clothes were dirty and he looked like he hadn't slept. Our eyes met for just a second, and I knew. I knew what he'd done. And I was too scared to say anything."

The kitchen fell silent except for the ticking of the wall clock.

"I'm not scared anymore," Vera said. "I'm seventy-one years old. What can they do to me now? If there's something I can do to help identify her, to give her family closure—her parents are long dead, but she has a sister in Cedar Rapids, nieces and nephews who never knew what happened to their aunt—I'll do it."

"We're investigating," Holly said. "Me and some other people. Trying to figure out the pattern, who else might be involved."

"The other women," Vera said. "The other bodies. They were queens too, weren't they?"

"We think so. At least some of them. Lorraine in 1952, someone in 1961, 1975, 1979. Maybe more we haven't found yet."

Vera closed her eyes. "All those years. All those girls. And everyone just accepted that they left town."

"Did you know any of the others?"

"Not well. I was older by then, had small children. But I remember Mary Petersen—1961. Pretty brunette, worked at the library. Engaged to a boy from Waterloo. She 'moved away' suddenly that fall. And Lisa Hendricks in 1975—I remember because my daughter was in 4-H with her. Sweet girl. She 'got a scholarship' to some school out east. Never came back."

"The Crowleys," Holly said. "Eugene, and now Vernon. This has been going on for decades."

"Longer, maybe. Thomas Crowley founded the fair in 1883. I don't know about back then, but..." Vera shook her head. "A pattern like this doesn't start with Eugene. He learned it somewhere."

Holly thought about the fair programs she'd researched, the missing queens going back to the 1940s. How far back did it really go?

"Grandma, if the police ask you to identify Lorraine—if they need dental records or DNA or anything—"

"I'll do whatever they need. It's time she came home. Past time." Vera squeezed Holly's hand. "But Holly, you be careful. If you're digging into this, if you're asking questions about the Crowleys—they're powerful people. They don't like being challenged."

"I know. We're being careful."

"Are you?" Vera's eyes were sharp despite her age. "Because my best friend was careful too. She was just going to run errands in town. And she never came home."

The words hung in the air like a warning.

Holly finished her too-sweet coffee and hugged her grandmother goodbye. She cycled back toward town for school, but her mind was racing. Sixty-one years. Vera had carried this knowledge for sixty-one years, knowing her best friend was murdered, knowing who did it, and staying silent out of fear.

How many other people in Ashfield knew? How many had seen something, suspected something, and said nothing because the Crowleys controlled everything?

The morning sun was bright and warm, but Holly felt cold. She thought about the pageant coming up—postponed now, but eventually it would happen again. They'd crown another queen, another pretty girl in a white dress and a sash.

Would she be safe?

Would any of them?

Holly pedaled faster, suddenly eager to be around other people, to be in the noise and safety of the high school hallways. Behind her, the fairgrounds sat quiet at the edge of town, its secrets partially revealed but far from fully understood.

And somewhere in Ashfield, someone who'd killed before and gotten away with it watched and waited to see what these amateur investigators would uncover.

Whether they'd let the investigation continue.

Or whether history would repeat itself, and more people would disappear for asking the wrong questions.
