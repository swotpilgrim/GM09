# Chapter 18: Going Over Their Heads

Aaron's motel room at the Crossroads Inn smelled like stale cigarettes and cleaner. Monday evening, the five of them crammed into a space designed for one. Jessie on the bed edge, Tammy in the only chair, Holly cross-legged on the floor. Wayne against the wall, arms crossed, on his second beer. Aaron by the dresser, case files spread everywhere.

"We have a problem," Aaron said. "Every official authority in this county is controlled or compromised by Vernon Crowley. Sheriff, coroner, editor, half the council. We can't go through normal channels."

"So what do we do?" Holly asked. "Let him get away with it?"

"No. But we have to be smart." Jessie's tone was firm. "Vernon has leverage over half the families here."

Tammy lit a cigarette, cracking the window. "He's already applying pressure. My salon got a surprise health inspection this morning. First in eight years. Two weeks to fix violations or face fines."

"Crowley-appointed inspector," Aaron said.

"Didn't say anything direct. Didn't have to."

Wayne took a long pull from his beer. "My landlord called. Wants to 'discuss' my lease. Six years, no problems. Now suddenly there's issues."

"Economic pressure. Vernon's playbook."

Jessie rubbed her temples. "Going to Sheriff Pritchard is pointless. They're in Vernon's pocket."

"So we go over their heads. Iowa State Police, Division of Criminal Investigation. They have jurisdiction over county corruption."

"They can just come in and take over?" Holly asked.

"If there's evidence of systematic corruption, yes. State DCI handles major crimes, public corruption, compromised local enforcement."

Tammy stubbed out her cigarette. "They'll believe us?"

"I have evidence." Aaron gestured to files. "Forensic reports. Financial records. Wayne's testimony. Victim profiles. Construction records. A hundred years of documentation."

Wayne reached for another beer. "State cops gonna protect us when Vernon really comes down?"

"That's why timing matters." Aaron pulled out a calendar. "Centennial pageant is in six days. Vernon will choose this year's queen. He might accelerate his timeline."

Holly went pale. "You think he'll grab someone from the pageant?"

"I think he believes it's his right." Aaron met her eyes. "We need state police intervention before the pageant."

"What's your plan?" Jessie asked.

Aaron spread a legal pad. "I have a contact—Detective Sarah Hendricks, Iowa State Police DCI. We served together, military police, Fort Riley '71-'73. I called her from a payphone outside the county. She'll meet us Wednesday, two PM. Truck stop off I-80, forty miles from here." He looked at each of them. "I need three people: me, Jessie, and Wayne. Evidence, local voice, and direct testimony about 1975."

Wayne's expression was unreadable. "You want me to confess to being an accessory to murder."

"I want you to testify about being coerced as a minor into helping dispose of a body under threat to your family." Aaron's voice was even. "Detective Hendricks indicated immunity might be possible in exchange for cooperation. No guarantees, but you're more valuable as a witness than a defendant."

"Might." Wayne laughed bitterly. "Might get immunity. Might get Vernon arrested before he has me killed. Might actually see justice for once in this shithole town."

"Wayne." Jessie's voice cut through his spiral. "I know you're scared. We all are. But if you don't testify, Vernon walks. Lisa Hendricks stays buried with sixteen other women, and nobody pays for what happened to them. Is that what you want?"

Wayne was quiet for a long moment. "Lisa's sister. Detective Hendricks. That's her?"

"Yes," Aaron said. "She has personal investment in this case."

"She gonna arrest me on sight?"

"She's a professional. She wants Vernon more than she wants revenge on a seventeen-year-old kid who was blackmailed." Aaron paused. "But you'll need to be honest. Complete honesty. Details, timeline, what Eugene said, how he threatened your family. Everything."

Wayne nodded slowly. "Okay. I'll do it. But I want it on record—I was a kid. I was scared. And I've hated myself for eight years."

"We'll make sure that's clear," Jessie said quietly.

Aaron returned to his notes. "The three of us meet Hendricks on Wednesday. We present everything—physical evidence, documentation, testimony. She decides whether there's enough to launch a full investigation and potentially bring in federal resources."

"What about the rest of us?" Tammy asked.

"Tammy, you stay in Ashfield. Maintain your network. If Vernon starts moving against witnesses or destroying evidence, we need to know immediately. You're our eyes and ears."

Tammy nodded. "I can do that."

"Holly." Aaron turned to her. "This is where it gets complicated. You're registered for the pageant. If you withdraw suddenly, it signals to Vernon that we're organizing resistance. He'll know something's happening."

"You want me to stay in the pageant." Holly's voice was steady, but her hands were clasped tight.

"I want you protected," Aaron said. "If you withdraw, you're safe but Vernon knows we're onto his pattern. If you stay in, we maintain the illusion that everything's normal, but you can't be alone. Not for a second."

Jessie shook her head. "Absolutely not. We're not using a seventeen-year-old as bait."

"I'm not suggesting bait. I'm suggesting controlled environment." Aaron looked at Holly. "No solo trips. No being anywhere without multiple witnesses. Pageant rehearsals happen in groups. You're with Jessie, Tammy, or your family at all other times. Vernon can't act if there are witnesses."

Holly considered this. "How long?"

"Four days until we meet Hendricks. Assuming she moves fast, another twenty-four to forty-eight hours for warrants and arrests. Six days maximum." Aaron's expression was serious. "Six days of being careful. Can you do that?"

"My grandmother," Holly said. "Can someone explain to her? Without telling her everything. Just... enough that she knows to keep me close."

"I'll talk to Vera," Tammy offered. "Woman deserves to know her granddaughter might be in danger."

Jessie stood, pacing the small room. "This is insane. We're talking about maintaining a cover story while meeting with state police, protecting a teenage girl from a serial killer, and hoping Vernon doesn't figure out what we're doing and start burning evidence or killing witnesses."

"Yes," Aaron said simply. "That's exactly what we're doing. Because the alternative is letting Vernon control the narrative, compromise the investigation, and potentially kill again."

"And if something goes wrong?" Jessie demanded. "If Vernon figures it out? If he goes after Holly or Wayne or any of us before state police can move?"

Aaron met her gaze. "Then we've documented everything. Multiple copies, stored offsite. Detective Hendricks has backup files as of this afternoon—I mailed them to her DCI office. If something happens to any of us, the evidence survives. Vernon can kill witnesses, but he can't kill the truth."

The weight of that statement settled over the room.

Tammy broke the silence. "When do we start?"

"Now." Aaron began distributing papers. "Everyone gets a copy of the contact protocol. If you see anything suspicious—Vernon acting strange, officials asking questions, anyone following you—you call the emergency number. It's a state police tip line, routed directly to Hendricks. Don't use your home phone. Payphone only, and assume someone might be listening."

Wayne took his copy, scanned it. "Paranoid much?"

"Appropriately cautious," Aaron corrected. "Vernon's killed seventeen times. His family has controlled this county for generations. We treat this like a military operation."

Jessie took her papers. "What do we tell people? They're going to notice we're meeting."

"Keep it vague. Fair logistics. Derby details. Vendor booths. Pageant prep. Nothing that suggests investigation."

"Lie to everyone," Wayne muttered.

"Protect everyone. The more people who know, the more danger they're in. We keep the circle small until state police can establish protection."

Holly stood, brushing off her jeans. "I should get home. Grandpa will worry if I'm out too late."

"I'll drive you," Jessie offered. "Make sure you get there safe."

Aaron gathered the remaining files, boxing them carefully. "Wednesday, two PM. Interstate 80, truck stop at mile marker 247. Jessie, Wayne, and I meet Detective Hendricks. Everyone else maintains normal routines and stays alert."

They filed out one by one. Tammy first, checking the parking lot before heading to her car. Holly and Jessie together. Wayne last, finishing his beer and crushing the can.

Aaron closed the door behind them, locked it, and returned to his files. He needed to create one more backup set, store it somewhere Vernon couldn't reach. Maybe the bank safety deposit box in Des Moines. Maybe mail it to his ex-wife for safekeeping.

Somewhere it would survive even if he didn't.

He was reorganizing documents when he heard footsteps outside. Slow, deliberate. Then nothing.

Aaron moved to the window, careful not to silhouette himself. The parking lot was dark except for a few scattered floodlights. His truck sat in its spot, three spaces from the office. No movement visible.

Probably nothing. Paranoia from too many years as MP, too many situations where relaxing got people killed.

He returned to his work.

Twenty minutes later, he decided to make a coffee run. The motel office had a machine that produced something vaguely coffee-like. Better than nothing.

He opened the door, stepped outside, and froze.

All four of his truck tires were flat. Slashed, from the look of it—clean cuts, deliberate.

And on his windshield, held down by the wiper blade, a note. White paper, block letters written in black marker:

**LEAVE TOWN.**

Aaron stood in the parking lot, heart rate elevated but expression calm. He scanned the darkness. No movement, no cars idling, no obvious surveillance. Whoever had done this was gone.

He pulled on gloves from his pocket—always carried them, habit from evidence handling—and carefully removed the note, touching only the edges. Placed it in a plastic evidence bag he kept in his door pocket.

Then he walked to the motel office.

The night clerk looked up from his magazine. "Help you?"

"Someone vandalized my truck. Slashed all four tires. I need to file a police report and call a tow service."

The clerk's eyes widened. "Serious? Man, that sucks. Want me to call the sheriff?"

"No." Aaron's voice was flat. "I'll handle it. Just need to use your phone."

He called the state police tip line first. Left a message for Detective Hendricks: "Evidence of intimidation. Four slashed tires, threatening note. Escalation confirmed. Wednesday meeting critical."

Then he called a twenty-four-hour tow service from Des Moines. Sixty miles away, but outside Eldon County. Outside Vernon's immediate reach.

Back in his room, Aaron photographed the note from every angle, documented the tire damage with his camera, and added the incident report to his files.

Vernon was nervous. Applying pressure. Hoping to scare them off.

Which meant they were close. Close enough that Vernon felt threatened.

Close enough to be dangerous.

Aaron locked his door, wedged a chair under the handle, and returned to his documentation. Four hours until the tow truck arrived. Four hours to finalize the case file, make final copies, and prepare for Wednesday.

Four hours until he could sleep, knowing Vernon Crowley was starting to panic.

And panicked men made mistakes.
