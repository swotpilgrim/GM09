# Chapter 14: Family Legacy

The county records office basement smelled like mildew and old paper. Aaron had spent Wednesday morning pulling files on the Crowley family back to Ashfield's founding. Marriage certificates, death certificates, property deeds, clippings. Building a family tree that revealed three generations of dysfunction.

Jessie and Tammy worked at adjacent tables, surrounded by documents. Systematic research, trying to understand not just what the Crowleys had done, but why.

Aaron spread his findings across the table. "Thomas Crowley arrived in Iowa in 1882. Age twenty-six, originally from Boston. Within a year, he'd acquired two hundred acres of prime farmland through what the records describe as 'settlement negotiation' with the indigenous Meskwaki people."

"Theft," Jessie said flatly. "That's what settlement negotiation meant back then."

"Essentially. By 1883, Thomas had established Ashfield—named after his mother's family. Built the general store, grain elevator, claimed title of mayor. The county fair was founded 1884."

Aaron pulled out a photograph—1880s tintype showing Thomas in front of a barn. Stern, dark suit, commanding face.

"Thomas married in 1885 to Abigail Porter, daughter of a Cedar Rapids banker. She died in 1890, complications from influenza. Thomas never remarried."

Tammy looked up from her newspapers. "But he had female 'companions' afterward. Society page mentions of Thomas with various young women. Different woman almost every year. None married him."

"'Associations,'" Aaron said. "That's the term in church records. Thomas had 'associations' with young women. Coded language. Clear subtext."

He laid out a timeline. "First confirmed missing fair queen—Sarah Mitchell, 1891. Second—Catherine Barnes, 1898. Third—Elizabeth Howe, 1907. Fourth—Margaret Sullivan, 1916. Thomas died in 1919 of pneumonia. Four murders over twenty-eight years."

"Slower than Eugene," Jessie noted.

"Different era. Smaller population, fewer opportunities. Thomas was establishing the tradition, the system." Aaron pulled out another document. "He left everything to his son, Thomas Junior, but Junior died in France during World War I, 1918. The estate passed to Thomas's nephew—Eugene Crowley, age eighteen."

The family tree was starting to look like a diagram of generational trauma. Thomas to Eugene, Eugene to Vernon, a line of inheritance that included murder.

"Eugene," Aaron continued, pulling Eugene's marriage certificate. "Married Anna Keller in 1946, age forty-six. She was twenty-two. Anna became Vernon's mother."

"Keller," Jessie said. "Any relation to Wayne?"

"Wayne's great-aunt. I asked him yesterday. Wayne's family has been tied to the Crowleys for three generations."

Tammy whistled low. "Jesus. No wonder Eugene knew he could trust Wayne. Family obligation."

Aaron found the death certificate he'd been looking for. "Anna Crowley died in 1968, officially listed as heart failure. She was forty-four years old. But I talked to the retired county clerk this morning—she remembers whispers that it was suicide. Pills. Anna had become increasingly reclusive, stopped attending church, stopped participating in community events."

"She knew," Jessie said quietly. "About the murders. Living with Eugene, seeing his 'interest' in the fair queens year after year. She knew and it destroyed her."

"Likely." Aaron laid out photographs—Eugene and Anna at various public events in the 1950s and 60s. In the early photos, Anna smiled. By the 1960s, her expression was hollow, haunted.

Tammy found another photograph. "Look at this. Eugene Crowley at the 1952 fair with that year's queen, Lorraine Fisher. Same photograph Holly found in the fair programs."

The image showed Eugene, hand on Lorraine's shoulder, looking at her instead of the camera. Possessive, evaluating. Lorraine smiled at the camera, unaware that within months she'd be buried under the main stage.

"Eugene's pattern was more aggressive than Thomas's," Aaron said, consulting his timeline. "Nine murders between 1947 and 1979. Thirty-two years. One every three and a half years on average. The frequency increased as he aged—five murders between 1964 and 1979, fifteen years."

"Escalation," Jessie said. "The compulsion intensifying."

"And always the same method—strangulation or blunt force trauma. Always buried during construction projects. Always queens who'd rejected his advances." Aaron pulled out Wayne's statement, now officially documented. "Wayne testified that Eugene said, 'Crowley men don't get told no.' That was the unforgivable sin. Refusal."

Tammy was flipping through marriage records. "Vernon. I found his first marriage certificate. 1950, age twenty-two. Elizabeth Monroe, age nineteen. Beautiful girl—there's a photograph attached. Looks like something from a movie."

The photograph showed a young woman with dark hair and delicate features, wearing a wedding dress. She looked radiantly happy.

"She died in childbirth the next year," Aaron said. "1951. The baby—a son—was stillborn. Vernon lost his wife and his heir in one night."

The room fell silent for a moment. That kind of tragedy broke people. Turned grief into rage, loss into violence.

"Second wife," Aaron continued. "Nancy Williams, married 1954. Vernon was twenty-six, Nancy was twenty-three. No children. She's still alive, still married to him. Forty-nine years."

"Forty-nine years of knowing what he is," Jessie said. "Or suspecting. Living in that house, seeing him with the pageant contestants every summer, finding excuses for his late nights and dirty clothes."

"Victim or accomplice?" Tammy asked.

"Both, maybe. Or neither." Aaron thought about the patterns of domestic abuse, the way trauma bonded people to their abusers. "Nancy's trapped. Either she knows and stays out of fear, or she's convinced herself not to know. Willful blindness as survival mechanism."

He laid out the complete family tree now—three generations, three men, seventeen confirmed murders and likely more.

"This is the pattern," Aaron said. "Thomas established it—control through land ownership, political power, and selection of young women through the pageant system. He taught Eugene, who refined the method and increased frequency. Eugene taught Vernon, who inherited the entire system intact."

"It's not madness," Jessie said slowly, understanding crystallizing. "It's tradition. Family legacy. They believed they had the right."

"Exactly. Thomas felt entitled to indigenous land, to political power, to young women's bodies. That entitlement passed to Eugene, then Vernon. Each generation believing their position in the community gave them ownership of the most beautiful, accomplished girls. The pageant wasn't just cover for murder—it was a selection process. A shopping catalog."

Aaron pulled out a final photograph—Vernon Crowley at the 1979 fair with Jennifer Cole, the last queen before the current pageant. Same pose as Thomas and Eugene before him. Hand on her shoulder, eyes assessing, smile proprietary.

Jennifer Cole disappeared three months later.

"They genuinely don't see it as wrong," Aaron said. "From their perspective, they're exercising rightful privilege. Maintaining tradition. The women who refuse are violating the natural order, so they must be punished. Then they're kept—the trophies, the sashes—as proof of power. As victory mementos."

"Ritualized violence," Tammy said. "Disguised as civic duty."

"Ritual is the right word. The pageant every summer, always the same structure. The mayor crowning the queen, photograph with his hand on her shoulder, the proprietary claim made public. Then the private approach—job offer, scholarship, opportunity. If she accepts, she's rewarded. If she refuses..." Aaron gestured at the list of dead women.

Jessie stood up, walked to the wall where Aaron had posted the family tree. Three men, a hundred years, seventeen names.

"Elizabeth died in childbirth," she said. "Vernon's first wife. The baby too. Do you think...?"

"The queens are surrogates?" Aaron nodded. "Likely. Vernon lost his wife and son in 1951. First murder we can confirm is 1979—twenty-eight years later. He watched his father kill for three decades before starting himself. But when he did, it wasn't just about power. It was about replacement. Young women in white dresses, beautiful and untouchable, symbols of what he lost."

"That's why he keeps the trophies," Tammy said. "The sashes, the hair, the jewelry. They're not just proof of murders. They're his collection. His substitute family."

"Seventeen surrogate wives," Jessie whispered. "Seventeen women who said no, so he buried them with their crowns."

Aaron looked at his research. A hundred years of documents revealing the architecture of systematic violence.

This was a system. Not structural engineering but social engineering. Generational wealth and power built on theft and murder, maintained through financial control and corruption. Thomas stole land, established dominance, created the pageant. Eugene inherited, refined, bought off authorities. Vernon continued, believing it was his birthright.

"We're not fighting one serial killer," Aaron said. "We're fighting a hundred years of entitlement. Three generations of men who believed they owned this town and everyone in it."

"Can we win?" Tammy asked.

Aaron thought about the state police, about Detective Chen reviewing evidence, about arrest warrants being prepared. About the institutional corruption that had enabled this for a century.

"We have to," he said. "Because the alternative is letting it continue. Letting Vernon choose another girl at the centennial pageant. Letting a hundred years of murder remain justice-free."

Jessie came back to the table. "Vernon's watching us. Has been for days. He knows we're investigating. Sheriff Pritchard visited my farm this morning—said I should 'let professionals handle the forensics work' and 'avoid spreading unfounded rumors.'"

"Threat," Aaron said.

"Thinly veiled. But yes." Jessie's jaw was set. "Which means we're close to something Vernon can't allow. We're threatening the system that's protected him his entire life."

"What do we do?" Tammy asked.

"We finish this research. We document everything. And we trust that state police will move before Vernon does." Aaron checked his watch. "Chen said they'd have surveillance on Vernon within forty-eight hours. It's been thirty-six."

"Twelve more hours," Jessie said. "Then he's being watched."

"What happens between now and then?" Tammy asked.

None of them had an answer. They just gathered their documents, organized their findings, and hoped twelve hours wasn't too long.

Outside the records office, Ashfield continued its normal routines. People shopping on Main Street, farmers at the grain elevator, kids riding bikes in the July sun.

Normal. Safe. Built on bones and maintained by silence.

Aaron thought about systems again. How they held up, how they broke.

This one was about to come down.
