# Chapter 1: Setup Day

Jessie Carter's pickup rumbled through the fairgrounds gate at six in the morning, gravel crunching under the tires. The September sun hadn't cleared the horizon yet, leaving the Eldon County Fairgrounds wrapped in that soft blue light that came just before dawn. She cut the engine and sat for a moment, hands still on the wheel, looking out at forty acres of her childhood.

The Ferris wheel stood silent against the lightening sky. Exhibition halls with peeling white paint lined the main avenue. The livestock barns—red and white structures from the twenties—waited for the animals arriving later this week. Bunting hung from posts, red and white and blue, ready for the centennial celebration.

One hundred years. The thought settled in her chest, warm and complicated. The Eldon County Fair had been running since 1883, and this year marked the centennial anniversary. Jessie had coordinated the livestock exhibits for five years now, since her mother got too sick to do it. Those last months, Mom had sat at the kitchen table with her lists and schedules, teaching Jessie everything—which families showed which breeds, who needed extra space for equipment, how to handle the rivalry between the 4-H kids and the FFA chapter.

Jessie grabbed her clipboard and thermos and climbed out of the truck. The morning smelled like cut grass and diesel fuel and the lingering sweetness of the wild asters that grew along the fence line. From somewhere across the grounds came the beep-beep-beep of heavy equipment backing up. Setup had started yesterday, but today the real work began.

She headed toward the livestock barns first, her boots leaving dark tracks in the dew-wet grass. A work crew was already there, setting up the penning system. She exchanged greetings, made notes about rusted gate hinges, confirmed the straw delivery.

As the sun came up, she worked her way through the grounds, checking off items. The midway rides were being assembled, carousel horses lying on tarps. A radio crackled from one of the ride trailers, playing Fleetwood Mac between bursts of static.

By seven-thirty, the fairgrounds had transformed from sleeping to buzzing. Pickup trucks and vans crowded the service road. Men in work gloves hauled equipment. Someone had started a coffee pot in the exhibition hall, and the smell drifted out through the open doors.

Jessie was checking the electrical hookups on the livestock barn when she saw the unfamiliar car pull up to the main stage area—a Ford sedan, clean and official-looking, with a clipboard visible through the windshield. A man got out, carrying an honest-to-God briefcase and a yellow hard hat.

She walked over, curious. The man was studying the stage foundation with a frown, making notes.

"Help you with something?"

He glanced up. Early thirties, she guessed. Dark hair, wire-rim glasses, button-down shirt with the sleeves already rolled up despite the morning cool. He had the look of someone from the city—too neat for farm country.

"Aaron Webb. County safety inspector." He didn't offer his hand, just nodded at the stage. "I'm here for the centennial liability review. Your insurance company required it."

"Right. Jessie Carter. I'm coordinating livestock, but I can show you around if you need."

"I have the blueprints." He adjusted his glasses, squinting at the stage framework. "This foundation settlement pattern is irregular. How old is this structure?"

Jessie looked at the stage. They'd been using it for pageants and announcements since before she was born. "Seventy-nine, maybe? They rebuilt it after the tornado."

"Seventy-nine as in 1979? Four years old?"

"Yeah."

Aaron crouched down, peering at where the wooden platform met the concrete foundation. "The settling suggests soil disturbance significantly older than four years. Do you have documentation of soil testing before construction?"

Jessie bit back a smile. "This is Ashfield, not Des Moines. We don't usually soil-test before we build a stage."

"That explains the code violations I'm already noting." He made another mark on his clipboard.

The smile died. "Look, this fair has been running safe for a hundred years—"

"Statistical survivorship bias isn't the same as safety compliance, Ms. Carter."

Before Jessie could respond, a woman's voice called out from the exhibition hall. "Jessie! You got a minute, hon?"

Tammy Sullivan stood in the doorway of Hall C, waving. She'd set up her booth already—Jessie could see the banner reading "TAMMY'S BEAUTY BARN—CENTENNIAL SPECIAL: UPDOS $5" hanging above a card table covered in curling irons and Aqua Net.

"Excuse me," Jessie said to Aaron, who had already gone back to examining the foundation.

Tammy met her halfway, walking fast in heeled ankle boots that had no business on fairground grass. Her blonde hair was teased high, and she wore a sweatshirt with rhinestone lettering that said "Iowa Girl."

"Who's the guy with the clipboard?" Tammy asked, pulling out a cigarette. "He looks like he's never seen a dirt lot in his life."

"County inspector. Here to tell us everything we're doing wrong."

"Oh, for crying out loud." Tammy lit her cigarette with a pink Bic lighter. "Did you hear about Wayne?"

"What about him?"

"Got thrown out of the VFW last night. Drunk, fighting with someone about the demolition derby rules. He showed up here an hour ago looking like death warmed over."

Jessie sighed. Wayne Keller ran the demolition derby every year, and every year he brought drama with him. "Where is he now?"

"Down at the derby pit, arguing with the fence crew."

"Great. I'll talk to him."

"Good luck with that." Tammy took a drag. "Oh, and Holly Brennan's been here since six, decorating the 4-H building like her life depends on it. That girl's got more energy than sense."

Despite everything, Jessie smiled. "She's excited about the centennial."

"She's seventeen. Everything's exciting." Tammy patted Jessie's arm. "I'm making coffee runs at nine if you want. The stuff in the hall tastes like motor oil."

Jessie found Wayne at the demolition derby pit—a sunken oval ringed with concrete barriers and chain-link fence. He stood with his arms crossed, glaring at two workers who were reinforcing a section of fence.

"Wayne."

He turned. Tammy was right—he looked rough. Bloodshot eyes, unshaven, smelling like beer and cigarettes. His Harley-Davidson t-shirt had a stain on it.

"Jessie. These idiots are trying to tell me I can't run the derby on Saturday night."

"That's not what we said," one of the workers protested. "We said the fence needs inspection—"

"Fence is fine. Been fine for ten years."

"Wayne, if the inspector says it needs checking—"

"Inspector?" Wayne's face darkened. "That guy with the clipboard? Who the hell is he to—"

"He's county safety, and yeah, he's uptight, but we need sign-off for the insurance."

Wayne spat into the dirt. "This is bullshit. Fair's been running forever without some pencil-pusher from Des Moines telling us what's safe."

"Just let him do his job, okay? Don't make this harder than it needs to be."

He stared at her for a long moment, jaw working like he wanted to say something else. Then he shook his head and turned away, pulling a flask from his back pocket.

"Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say, Jessie."

She left him there and headed back toward the main grounds, her earlier good mood thoroughly punctured. Wayne had always been difficult, but lately he'd gotten worse—drinking more, angrier, like something was eating at him from the inside.

Near the 4-H exhibition hall, Holly Brennan was hanging a banner that read "100 YEARS OF AGRICULTURAL EXCELLENCE." The seventeen-year-old wore a green 4-H polo shirt, her strawberry-blonde hair in a practical braid. She waved enthusiastically when she saw Jessie.

"Isn't it beautiful? Grandpa Earl helped me paint it!" Holly's whole face was lit up with excitement. "He told me stories about the old fairs. I'm entering the pageant this year."

Jessie felt something tighten in her chest. Holly was sweet and smart and wanted to be a veterinarian.

"Good luck with it," she said.

The morning wore on. Aaron Webb appeared periodically with technical questions. Tammy made her coffee run and came back with gossip. Wayne stayed at the derby pit, drinking and glowering.

Around ten-thirty, Jessie was inspecting the show ring when she heard shouting from the main stage area.

She jogged over to find a crowd gathered around the excavator that had been digging foundation supports for stage expansion. The construction foreman—Dave Mullins, who'd built half the buildings in Ashfield—stood next to the excavator bucket, his face pale.

Aaron Webb was already there, clipboard forgotten on the ground.

"What happened?" Jessie pushed through the crowd.

Dave pointed at the excavator bucket, still suspended in the air. "Hit something hard. Thought it was rock, but then—"

Jessie stepped closer and looked into the bucket.

The bones were unmistakable. Old and dirt-stained, but clearly human. A skull, partially intact. Pieces of what might have been a ribcage. The bones rested among the disturbed earth like some terrible archaeological find.

The fairgrounds seemed to go quiet. No one spoke. Even the radio playing Fleetwood Mac from the midway sounded far away.

Aaron moved first, pulling a camera from his briefcase. "No one touch anything. This is a potential crime scene."

Dave backed away from the excavator. "Jesus Christ. We were just digging the foundation supports. How the hell—"

"How deep?" Aaron asked, already photographing the bucket from multiple angles.

"Four feet, maybe? We were going down to the frost line."

Jessie stared at the bones. Her mind felt slow, like it couldn't quite process what she was seeing. Someone had been buried here. Under the stage. Under the place where they crowned the fair queens and announced the pie contest winners and played the national anthem every year on opening night.

Someone had been buried here for a long time.

"I'm calling the sheriff," Aaron said.

Jessie nodded, not trusting herself to speak. Around them, the crowd murmured and shifted. Tammy appeared at Jessie's elbow, for once completely silent, her cigarette burning forgotten between her fingers.

The morning sun climbed higher, bright and merciless, illuminating every detail of the scene—the excavator bucket, the bones, the disturbed earth, and the faces of everyone gathered around, trying to understand what this meant for their fair, their town, their history.

One hundred years, Jessie thought again. But this time the weight in her chest wasn't warm. It was cold and heavy and tasted like fear.
