# Chapter 11: Mayor Crowley's Control

The photographs were spread across both motel beds Saturday evening.

Seventeen sashes. White silk, gold lettering, labeled with dates and names. Proof of a century of murder.

Aaron stood by the window, watching reactions. Shock, horror, silence. No one spoke for five minutes.

Finally, Tammy picked up one of the photographs—the image of Lorraine Fisher's sash, *1952* written in careful script on the masking tape label.

"My God," she whispered. "It's real. It's all real."

"Seventeen sashes," Jessie said. Voice flat, exhausted. She'd driven straight from the estate, hands shaking. "Jewelry. Hair samples. Photographs. Trophies from every woman he killed."

Holly sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the photos. "All the names from my list. Every missing queen. They're all there."

"This is evidence," Aaron said, his military precision kicking in. "Physical evidence of serial murder. We need to contact Iowa State Police immediately. Tonight. Bypass Sheriff Pritchard entirely."

"Wait." Jessie looked up at him. "Before we do that, I need to understand something. Vernon's been killing for decades. His father before him. A hundred years of murder. How did no one know? How did they get away with it?"

"People knew," Wayne said from the corner. He'd shown up ten minutes ago, already half-drunk, and hadn't moved since seeing the photographs. "People always know. They just don't say anything."

"Because of this." Tammy pulled out her notebook. "Sheriff Pritchard. Elected twelve years ago with Crowley campaign funding. Owns a house purchased from Crowley Properties in 1975 for forty-three thousand when comparable homes sold for sixty. On the Crowley payroll since before he was sheriff."

"Bought," Aaron said.

"Bought and paid for." Tammy turned pages. "County Coroner Dr. Harold Hess—medical practice loan from Crowley Bank, nineteen sixty-eight, below standard interest rate. Still being repaid. Ashfield Gazette editor Tom Wilson—the Crowley family trust owns forty percent of the newspaper. Judge Martha Chen—her son works for Crowley Construction. You see the pattern?"

"The whole system is compromised," Jessie said quietly. "Every position of authority in this town is financially tied to the Crowleys."

Aaron studied Tammy's notes. The web of corruption was extensive. Not just the sheriff, but the coroner, the newspaper, the judge.

"This explains a century of control," he said. "An entire institutional structure protecting the Crowleys. Every person in authority owes them money, favors, or their livelihood."

"And anyone who pushes back loses everything," Jessie added. "Like Vernon threatened me today. He knew I was asking questions. Told me curiosity was dangerous, that my family's standing in the community could be jeopardized."

"He threatened you?" Holly's voice rose. "Jessie, he knows you're investigating—"

"He suspects someone is. He doesn't know for certain it's me. But yes, he's aware people are asking questions." Jessie looked at the photographs again. "Which means we need to move fast. Once he checks that barn and sees the broken lock, sees the trunk's been photographed—"

"How long before he notices?" Aaron asked.

"Could be days. Could be tomorrow. I don't know how often he goes into that locked room." Jessie met his eyes. "But when he does, he'll know."

The weight of that settled over the room. They'd found the evidence, but they'd also tipped their hand. The countdown had begun.

"We go to state police," Aaron said firmly. "First thing tomorrow morning. We drive to Des Moines with these photographs and everything we've compiled. We request a meeting with the state investigative division, explain the situation, hand over the evidence."

"Will they believe us?" Holly asked. "Vernon's a mayor. He's respected. We're just—"

"We're citizens presenting physical evidence of serial murder," Aaron interrupted. "And I have contacts from my Army days who can help fast-track this through proper channels. My former CO knows people in Iowa law enforcement. We can get to someone who isn't compromised."

Tammy flipped through her notebook. "There's something else. Nancy Crowley."

"Vernon's wife?" Jessie asked.

"Quiet woman. People describe her as passive, withdrawn. Stopped coming to Ladies' Auxiliary five years ago." Tammy's expression was troubled. "Her bridge club said she showed up with bruises around 1980. Always had excuses. Fell down stairs, walked into doors, clumsy with gardening."

"Domestic abuse," Aaron said.

"Almost certainly. Which raises the question—does she know about the murders?"

"She'd have to," Wayne said. Everyone turned to look at him. He took a drink from his flask, not meeting anyone's eyes. "Can't kill that many women over that many years without your wife knowing something. Even if she doesn't know details, she knows he's dangerous."

"But is she complicit or terrified?" Holly asked.

Tammy flipped another page. "There's more. Vernon's first wife—before Nancy—was named Elizabeth. They married young, 1950. She died in childbirth a year later, 1951. The baby died too. Vernon was twenty-two years old, lost his wife and his son in one night."

The room went quiet.

"Queens as surrogates," Aaron said slowly. "Losing his wife and child traumatized him. The pageant queens—young, beautiful, in white dresses like brides—they might represent what he lost. When they reject him, when they refuse his advances—"

"They become substitutes for his wife who left him through death," Jessie finished. "It's not just power and control. It's deeply psychological. He's reenacting his trauma through murder."

"Jesus," Tammy muttered.

Holly was staring at the photographs of the sashes, her face pale. "I'm in the pageant. So are four other girls. If Vernon chooses one of us—"

"We'll have him in custody before the pageant," Aaron said firmly. "State police will act immediately once they see this evidence. We get these photos to Des Moines tomorrow, explain the situation, and within twenty-four hours there will be arrest warrants."

"You hope," Wayne said darkly.

"I know," Aaron corrected. "This isn't circumstantial anymore. This is physical evidence of trophy-keeping from seventeen murders. No defense lawyer can explain this away. Vernon Crowley is done."

Jessie picked up one of the photographs—the image of the trunk itself, full of sashes and jewelry and hair samples, decades of souvenirs from murdered women. Undeniable. Damning.

"My mother helped coordinate pageants," she said quietly. "For twenty years, she did makeup for contestants, helped them practice their walks. She loved those girls. Believed the pageant was giving them opportunities, building their confidence. She never knew she was helping prepare them for slaughter."

"She couldn't have known," Tammy said gently. "None of us could. That was the Crowleys' genius—hiding murder inside tradition, inside celebration. Making it invisible."

"Not anymore." Jessie's voice hardened. "Tomorrow we make it visible. We take this evidence to people who aren't afraid of Vernon Crowley, people who don't owe him money or favors. We end this."

Aaron started organizing the photographs into a folder, creating a proper evidence package. Chain of custody would be important for prosecution. He made notes—time discovered, location, method of documentation, witnesses present.

"What about Wayne's testimony?" Tammy asked. "If he was present for one of the burials—"

"No," Wayne said immediately. "I'm not testifying to anything."

"Wayne, you're an eyewitness—"

"I'm a goddamn accomplice!" Wayne stood abruptly, swaying. "I helped bury Lisa Hendricks. Me, with my own hands. Eugene paid me fifty bucks and I dug the grave and kept my mouth shut for eight years. You think state police are gonna see me as a witness? I'm going to prison."

"You were seventeen," Jessie said. "Coerced by someone with power over your family. That's not the same as—"

"It's exactly the same. I knew what I was doing. I knew that was a body, that she was dead, that Eugene killed her. And I buried her and took the money anyway." Wayne's voice cracked. "So don't ask me to testify. I've got nothing to say that won't put me in a cell next to Vernon."

He stumbled toward the door.

"Wayne, wait—" Holly started.

"I'm done. You got your evidence. You don't need me." He pushed through the door, disappeared into the darkness outside.

Silence filled the motel room.

"He's right," Aaron said finally. "About being an accomplice. His testimony could help, but if he's unwilling, we don't need it. The physical evidence is enough."

"Is it?" Jessie asked. "Really? Vernon's a mayor with connections all the way to the state capitol. He's rich, powerful, respected. We're bringing photographs of things we found by breaking into his property. What if his lawyers argue illegal search, inadmissible evidence?"

Aaron had considered that. "It's a risk. But the alternative is letting him continue killing. The pageant is in nine days. If we wait, if we try to build a perfect legal case—"

"Someone else dies," Tammy finished.

"So we go tomorrow," Jessie said. "First thing. We drive to Des Moines, we find state police who aren't compromised, and we hand over everything. Let them decide what to do with it."

Aaron nodded. He'd make calls tonight, reach out to his old contacts, try to arrange a meeting with someone high enough in Iowa law enforcement to be beyond the Crowleys' reach. It wouldn't be easy. But it was possible.

They had proof. They had a case. They had a chance.

"Everyone go home," he said. "Get some sleep. Meet back here at six a.m. We leave for Des Moines by six-thirty."

The group dispersed slowly. Tammy gathered her notes. Holly picked up one last photograph of a sash—Lisa Hendricks, 1975—and stared at it for a long moment before setting it down.

When everyone was gone, Aaron sat alone in his motel room surrounded by evidence of a hundred years of murder. He thought about the engineering of it all—the careful planning, the systems of control, the institutional corruption that allowed atrocity to continue generation after generation.

His whole life he'd believed in structure, in systems, in the idea that if you built things correctly they'd hold.

But systems could be corrupted. Structure could enable horror. And sometimes the only way to stop it was to tear the whole thing down.

Tomorrow they'd try.

Tomorrow they'd fight back against a family that had owned this town for a century.

And either they'd succeed, or they'd become the next people Vernon Crowley destroyed.
