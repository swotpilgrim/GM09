# Chapter 23: The Dark Moment

The excavation sites looked like open graves under September rain. Thursday morning, Jessie Carter stood at the fairgrounds fence watching state police forensic teams work methodically through seventeen burial locations. Each hole marked with numbered flags, yellow crime scene tape flapping in the wind.

Seventeen women. Seventeen families waiting for DNA confirmation.

The rain had started Tuesday and hadn't stopped. Turned the fairgrounds into mud, slowed the excavation, made everything harder. Jessie pulled her jacket tighter and watched technicians in white protective suits carefully sift soil, photograph fragments, document evidence with clinical precision.

Some families came to watch. Stood in clusters outside the fence, silent. Waiting for their daughters, their sisters, their mothers to be identified after decades of not knowing.

Others stayed away. Preferred the uncertainty to the confirmation.

The centennial fair had been postponed indefinitely. No celebration this year. Maybe never again.

Behind Jessie, Main Street was empty. Mid-morning on a Thursday, and not a single car parked along the storefronts. The hardware store had closed early three days running. Preston's Café served maybe a dozen customers yesterday. The Ashfield Gazette office was dark—Tom Preston had stopped publishing when the national media took over the story.

*House of Horrors: Iowa Town's Century of Murder*

*Fair Queen Killer: Seventeen Women Buried Under County Fairgrounds*

*Small Town Mayor Accused of Serial Murder Spanning Three Generations*

The headlines kept coming. Television news trucks had camped outside Ashfield for a week before state police forced them back. Reporters knocked on doors, shoved microphones at anyone who'd talk, turned the tragedy into spectacle.

Tourism had vanished overnight. The bed-and-breakfast cancelled all reservations. The motel stood empty except for investigators. Vendors who'd planned to set up for the centennial fair pulled out—nobody wanted to sell funnel cakes on top of a mass grave.

Ashfield's economy was cratering.

And people blamed Jessie.

She'd heard the whispers at the grocery store, seen the looks at church Sunday. Some people understood—grateful the truth came out, relieved the murders were exposed. But others resented it. Thought she'd destroyed Ashfield's reputation, turned their town into a national joke, ruined businesses that had survived three generations.

*Why couldn't you just let the past stay buried?*

*Those girls were dead anyway. What good does digging them up do?*

*The Crowley family built this town. You destroyed it.*

Her father hadn't said anything directly. But he'd been quieter than usual. The farm equipment loan payment was due next month—$8,000, and the grain elevator wasn't accepting deliveries. Crowley-controlled grain elevator. With Vernon in custody, operations had frozen. Farmers couldn't sell their harvest, couldn't generate income, couldn't make loan payments.

The whole system was collapsing.

Jessie's phone rang twice Tuesday with vendor cancellations. Apologetic but firm—couldn't participate in Ashfield events, didn't want the association with the publicity, sorry but business is business.

She understood. Still stung.

Wednesday morning she'd driven to Tammy's salon and found the front window shattered. Spray paint across the brick: **TRAITOR**. Glass everywhere, rain blowing through the broken window, ruining the floor.

Tammy had been sitting in her salon chair when Jessie arrived, staring at the damage. Not crying. Just... hollow.

"Third business on Main Street this week," Tammy said quietly. "Sheriff says it's vandalism, probably teenagers. Won't investigate."

Jessie had helped her board up the window with plywood. They'd worked in silence, hammering boards while rain soaked through their clothes.

Aaron had received death threats. Phone calls to his motel room, three separate nights. Muffled voices, anonymous: *Leave town or you're dead. Mind your own business. We know where you sleep.*

State police monitored his phone, tried to trace the calls. Nothing definitive. Just fear, weaponized.

And Holly.

Holly had come to Jessie's house Tuesday night, pale and shaking. Someone had shoved a note through her locker at school: *Your family destroyed this town. Watch your back.*

Vera Brennan had pulled Holly out of classes Wednesday, said she'd finish the semester with homeschooling. Too dangerous. Too much harassment.

Seventeen-year-old girl punished for exposing the truth about her great-aunt's murder.

Jessie turned away from the excavation sites, walked through mud to her truck. The rain kept falling. Everything felt impossible, pointless, wrong.

That evening, the group met at Aaron's motel room—Jessie, Aaron, Tammy, Holly—minus Wayne, who'd vanished and might be dead for all they knew.

The mood was grim.

"Vernon's lawyer filed motions to suppress evidence," Aaron said, spreading legal documents across the dresser. "Claims the trophy trunk was obtained through illegal search, that Vernon's initial statements were coerced, that the excavation warrants were overly broad."

"Will it work?" Jessie asked.

"Probably not. But it delays trial, complicates prosecution. Vernon's claiming he never participated in murders—just 'preserved evidence' of his father's and grandfather's crimes. Says he kept the trophies because he was gathering courage to report Eugene to authorities."

Tammy lit a cigarette by the window. "That's bullshit. His handwriting is on half the labels. 1979 and 1981—those were his."

"Defense argues circumstantial. Says labeling family heirlooms doesn't prove murder." Aaron rubbed his eyes. "Physical evidence ties Vernon to the 1979 and 1981 victims—jewelry in his possession, DNA likely to match. But without Wayne's testimony about 1975, the pattern is weaker."

"Wayne's testimony was recorded," Jessie said.

"Recorded testimony without the witness present for cross-examination is less credible. Vernon's lawyers will argue it's hearsay, unreliable, coerced." Aaron's expression was tired. "We need Wayne. But he's gone."

Holly sat cross-legged on the floor, hands clasped around her knees. "The singing is worse."

Everyone looked at her.

"Since the excavations started. I hear it constantly. Seventeen voices now. Sorrowful, but insistent. Demanding acknowledgment." Holly's voice was strained. "I've been recording it. Same melody, different harmonies. Only I can hear it clearly on the tapes, but it's there."

Tammy studied her. "You okay, kid?"

"I don't know." Holly looked up. "I wanted to help. Wanted to honor Ruth, give the families closure. But now the town hates us. My grandmother cries every night. I can't go to school. And Vernon might get away with it anyway because his lawyers are better than our evidence."

Silence settled over the room, heavy.

Jessie stood, pacing the small space. "Maybe they're right. Maybe I should've left it buried."

"Jessie—" Aaron started.

"No, think about it. Seventeen women were already dead. Nothing we do brings them back. But exposing the murders destroyed the town. Businesses closing, families suffering, people getting death threats. Was it worth it? Did we help anyone, or did we just make everything worse?"

"You gave those families answers," Aaron said firmly. "Lorraine Fisher's daughter spent thirty years wondering if her mother abandoned her. Now she knows her mother was murdered. That's not nothing."

"It's also not enough to justify what's happening to Holly. To Tammy. To you."

"Justice is worth the cost."

"Is it?" Jessie's voice broke. "When the cost is threatening teenagers and vandalizing businesses and destroying a town's economy? When Vernon might walk anyway because he can afford better lawyers than the state can?"

Aaron stood, crossing to her. "The truth matters, Jessie. Even when it's painful. Especially when it's painful. Vernon Crowley killed women for a hundred years because nobody was willing to pay the cost of exposing him. You paid that cost. That took courage."

"Feels like stupidity."

"It's not." Tammy stubbed out her cigarette. "My salon can be repaired. Holly can finish school later. The town's economy will recover. But those seventeen women deserved acknowledgment. Deserved justice. You gave them that."

Holly nodded slowly. "The singing... it's not angry. It's grateful. They wanted to be heard. To be believed. Even if it cost us something."

Jessie sank onto the bed edge, exhausted. "I just want this to be over. I want Vernon convicted, the families to have closure, and Ashfield to heal. But it feels like we're moving backward. Like everything's getting worse instead of better."

"Dark before dawn," Aaron said quietly. "This is the hard part—when justice seems impossible and the consequences feel overwhelming. But we're close, Jessie. The forensic evidence is solid. Vernon's diary exists. The victims are being identified. This isn't over yet."

"And if he gets off?"

"He won't." Aaron's voice was certain. "I've seen corrupt men escape justice. Vernon isn't escaping. Too much evidence, too many witnesses, too much media scrutiny. His lawyers can delay, but they can't erase seventeen bodies and a trunk full of trophies."

Jessie wanted to believe him. Wanted to trust that justice would prevail, that the cost they'd paid would be worth it, that Ashfield would eventually heal.

But sitting in a motel room with death threats and vandalism and a missing witness, with seventeen graves open in the rain and a community fractured by truth, belief felt like luxury.

All she had was perseverance. The thin, stubborn thread of keep going because stopping means Vernon wins.

"What do we do now?" she asked.

"Wait," Aaron said. "Let the forensic teams finish. Let the prosecution build its case. Support each other. Trust the process."

"And if the process fails?"

"Then we fought anyway. We told the truth anyway. We honored seventeen women anyway." He met her eyes. "That's all we can do, Jessie. The rest is up to the courts."

---

That night, Jessie drove home through rain and darkness. Main Street was deserted, storefronts dark. The fairgrounds excavation sites sat under floodlights, state police still working through the night.

Seventeen women. Seventeen stories interrupted by violence and entitlement and a family that believed murder was their right.

She thought about the families watching the excavations. Waiting for DNA results. Preparing to bury daughters who should have grown old, married, had children of their own.

She thought about Vernon in his cell, lawyered up and defiant. Claiming innocence, blaming Eugene, insisting he'd done nothing wrong.

She thought about Ashfield—fractured, economically devastated, divided between those who wanted justice and those who wanted the past to stay buried.

And she thought about Holly's singing. Seventeen voices, sorrowful and insistent, demanding acknowledgment.

Maybe Aaron was right. Maybe truth was worth the cost, even when the cost felt unbearable.

Or maybe some truths destroyed more than they healed.

Jessie didn't know anymore.

She parked at the farm, walked through rain to the house. Inside, her father sat at the kitchen table with financial records spread before him. Loan statements, grain elevator receipts, vendor contracts.

He looked up when she entered. "Can we make it through winter?"

Jessie didn't know how to answer that.

Outside, the rain kept falling. And at the fairgrounds, seventeen graves waited for the dead to be named, acknowledged, finally given the justice they'd been denied for a century.

Whether that justice would be enough to save Ashfield—or whether the town would collapse under the weight of its own complicity—remained to be seen.
