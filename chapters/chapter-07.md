# Chapter 7: The Crowley Connection

The Eldon County Records Office sat in the courthouse basement, a windowless maze of filing cabinets and microfiche readers that smelled like old paper and dust. Jessie had been here dozens of times over the years—filing fair permits, checking property boundaries, looking up livestock regulations. The clerk, Martha Henderson, had known Jessie since she was a kid.

"Back again?" Martha asked from behind her desk when Jessie, Aaron, and Tammy walked in Thursday afternoon. "That's three times this week. You writing a book on Ashfield history?"

"Something like that," Jessie said, forcing a smile. "Need to look at some old records. Property deeds, construction permits."

"Help yourself. You know where everything is." Martha went back to her crossword puzzle.

They spread out across the basement. Aaron took the construction records, pulling permits and blueprints going back to the fairgrounds' founding. Tammy claimed the newspaper archives—decades of the Ashfield Gazette on microfiche. Jessie started with property records and mayoral archives.

An hour in, the pattern was undeniable.

"Thomas Crowley," Jessie read from a yellowed document dated 1883, "founder and first mayor of Ashfield, Iowa. Established the Eldon County Agricultural Fair on land donated by the Crowley family trust."

She pulled another file. "Eugene Crowley, elected mayor 1947. Served until retirement in 1979. Oversaw fairgrounds expansion and modernization."

And finally: "Vernon Crowley, elected mayor 1979. Current term."

Three generations. One hundred years of unbroken control.

Aaron joined her at the table, carrying an armload of construction permits. "Every major fairgrounds project from 1883 to present required mayoral approval. Every single one was approved and overseen by a Crowley. They didn't just control the fair—they controlled every nail, every board, every excavation."

"Access," Jessie said quietly. "They could be there any time, day or night. No one would question it."

Tammy appeared with a stack of photocopied newspaper clippings, her expression grim. "Look at these."

She spread them across the table. Photographs from various Ashfield Gazettes spanning decades. Each showed a Crowley man with that year's fair queen—Thomas in the 1890s and early 1900s, Eugene from the 1940s through 1970s, Vernon from 1980 onward.

The photographs were eerily similar. The mayor standing beside the crowned queen, hand on her shoulder or around her waist. The queen smiling at the camera. The mayor looking at her, not the camera. The same possessive posture across a century of images.

"Jesus," Aaron muttered.

"There's more," Tammy said. She pulled out her spiral notebook, filled with her looping handwriting. "I've been calling around, talking to the older ladies who remember. Every one of them mentioned how the Crowley men always 'took an interest' in the queens. Thomas would invite them to dinner at the mansion. Eugene gave them jobs at his businesses. Vernon offers scholarships, internships, 'opportunities.'"

"Grooming," Aaron said. "That's textbook predatory behavior."

Jessie flipped through the photographs, matching faces to the names Holly had compiled. There was Lorraine Fisher in 1952, standing next to Eugene Crowley. His hand rested on her shoulder. She was smiling, but Jessie could see it now—the slight tension in her posture, the way she leaned away just a fraction.

"Did any of them accept?" Jessie asked Tammy. "The jobs, the opportunities?"

"Some did. Those girls stayed in town, worked for Crowley businesses, married local men. The ones who said no..." Tammy trailed off, gesturing at the photographs of the missing queens.

Aaron pulled out his timeline, the one he'd been building all week. "Cross-referencing newspaper mentions: Lorraine Fisher, crowned July 1952, mentioned in August article about 'accepting employment opportunity in Chicago.' Mary Petersen, crowned July 1961, similar article in September. Lisa Hendricks, 1975. Jennifer Cole, 1979."

He looked up. "Every single missing queen has a newspaper article, published within months of her crowning, explaining her departure. The articles are brief, identical in structure, and they all quote the same source: the mayor's office."

"The Crowleys controlled the narrative," Jessie said. "They killed these women and then told the town a story everyone wanted to believe."

"And the newspaper printed it without question," Tammy added, "because the Crowleys owned stock in the paper. I looked it up yesterday—Crowley family trust has a forty percent stake in the Ashfield Gazette. Has since 1920."

The scope of control was staggering. An entire system designed to enable and conceal murder. The newspaper to control information. The sheriff to prevent investigation. Economic stranglehold to ensure compliance.

Jessie walked to the property records cabinet, pulled the county map.

"Here's the fairgrounds," she said. "And here's the Crowley estate. Two hundred acres. Mansion, outbuildings, farmland."

"How far?"

"Mile, maybe. Less cutting through fields. Five-minute drive."

"Close enough to transport bodies at night," Aaron said.

Jessie thought about all the times she'd been there—delivering paperwork, coordinating livestock, attending Vernon's Christmas parties. She'd walked past that barn dozens of times. Had the sashes been there? Seventeen trophies, hidden in plain sight?

"We need more than this," Aaron said, organizing the documents. "We have a pattern of control, suspicious behavior, and proximity. But defense attorneys will argue it's circumstantial. We need physical evidence tying the Crowleys directly to the crimes."

"Wayne knows something," Tammy said. "The way he reacts every time we mention the Crowleys? That's not just fear of powerful people. That's guilt."

As if summoned, the basement door opened and Wayne stumbled down the stairs. He looked worse than yesterday—his hair greasy, his clothes wrinkled, his eyes bloodshot and wild.

"Figured I'd find you here," he said, his words slightly slurred. "Playing detective in the basement."

"Wayne, are you drunk?" Jessie asked.

"Little bit." He laughed without humor. "Seemed like a good idea, considering what you're doing."

"What we're doing is trying to find justice for—"

"Justice?" Wayne's voice rose. "You think there's gonna be justice? You're going after the Crowleys. The fucking Crowleys. They own this town. They own the cops, the courts, the newspaper, the bank. They own everyone." His finger swung around to point at each of them. "Including you. All of you."

"Wayne—" Jessie started.

"No, you listen to me. You're messing with people who've been getting away with murder—literal murder—for a hundred years. You think they're gonna let some farmers and hairdressers and county inspectors take them down? You think they're just gonna roll over and confess?"

"Then what do you suggest?" Aaron asked calmly. "We just forget about it? Let them keep killing?"

"I suggest you get the hell out of Ashfield before they decide you know too much." Wayne's hands were shaking. "Before you end up in the ground like those girls."

"Is that what happened to you?" Jessie asked quietly. "Did they threaten you?"

Wayne went still. His eyes met hers, and for just a second she saw raw terror there.

"I don't know what you're talking about," he said finally.

"Wayne, if you know something about what happened—if they made you help, if they threatened you—"

"I don't know anything!" His shout echoed in the basement. Up at her desk, Martha looked over, frowning. Wayne lowered his voice to a harsh whisper. "I don't know anything, and neither do you. Drop this. Drop it before someone gets hurt."

He turned and stumbled back up the stairs, slamming the door behind him.

The three of them sat in silence for a moment.

"He was there," Aaron said finally. "At one of the burials. He helped them."

"He was a kid," Tammy said. "If the Crowleys threatened him, forced him—"

"He's been living with it ever since," Jessie finished. "That's why he drinks. That's why he's so angry all the time. He knows what they did and he kept quiet."

She looked at the property map again, at the Crowley estate sitting there like a spider at the center of a web. The mansion, the outbuildings, the barn.

"I'm going there," Jessie said. "To the estate. I need to see it for myself."

"Jessie, that's dangerous," Aaron warned. "If they catch you—"

"They won't. I coordinate livestock transport for the fair. I've got legitimate reasons to be there, checking on barn space, confirming equipment access. Vernon knows me. He trusts me." The words tasted bitter. "I can look around without raising suspicion."

"What are you looking for?" Tammy asked.

"I don't know. Anything. Everything. Some kind of physical evidence we can give to state police." Jessie folded the property map carefully. "Wayne's right that we can't beat them with just a pattern. We need proof. And if it exists, it's on that property."

"When?" Aaron asked.

"Tomorrow. Vernon will be at the town council meeting all afternoon—it's on the calendar at the courthouse. I'll go then."

"I'm coming with you," Aaron said.

"No. If anyone sees your car there, they'll know something's up. I go alone, like I've done a hundred times before." Jessie met his eyes. "You stay here and keep researching. Find out everything you can about the Crowley family history. Go back as far as the records go."

Aaron clearly didn't like it, but he nodded.

Tammy reached across the table and squeezed Jessie's hand. "You be careful, honey. Wayne might be a drunk, but he's not wrong about the Crowleys being dangerous."

"I know."

They gathered the documents they'd copied. Martha barely looked up as they left.

Outside, Ashfield looked peaceful—courthouse lawn mowed, flag snapping, people on Main Street going about their business. Normal. Safe.

Jessie knew better now.

She drove toward her farm but didn't go home. Instead she pulled onto a dirt road with a view of the Crowley estate.

The mansion sat on a low rise, white and imposing, windows gleaming. The barn—that massive red structure where her father had stored equipment, where Vernon held spring auctions.

Where, if her suspicions were right, seventeen women had been murdered.

Tomorrow, she thought. Tomorrow I'll know.

She sat in her truck, steeling herself. She'd known Vernon her entire life. He'd given her family a loan when they desperately needed it. Congratulated her on taking over livestock coordination. Shaken her hand at her mother's funeral.

And he'd probably killed seventeen women. Maybe more.

The weight pressed down on her shoulders. But when she thought about those photographs—Lorraine Fisher, Mary Petersen, Lisa Hendricks, all the others—she knew she couldn't turn back.

They deserved someone to fight for them.

Even if that someone was just a farmer's daughter in way over her head.

Jessie started her truck and drove home to plan.
