# Chapter 26: Seventeen Names

Holly Brennan stood in Ashfield Cemetery on a cold October morning, watching workers install a headstone that should have been placed twenty-two years ago.

*Ruth Ann Brennan*
*1943-1961*
*Beloved Sister, Daughter, Friend*
*Gone Too Soon, Never Forgotten*

Not true—the "never forgotten" part. Ruth had been forgotten. Erased. Turned into scandal and speculation, then into silence. Twenty-two years of her family believing she'd run away, abandoned them, chosen a different life somewhere else.

Twenty-two years of wrongly mourning someone who'd been murdered.

The DNA results had come back three weeks ago. Iowa State Police released the names publicly: seventeen women spanning 1884 to 1981. Lorraine Fisher, 1952. Ruth Brennan, 1961. Lisa Hendricks, 1975. Catherine Mills, 1979. Diana Foster, 1981. Twelve others, older, identified through forensic genealogy and historical records.

Seventeen names. Seventeen stories. Seventeen lives ended by Crowley men who believed murder was their right.

The media coverage had shifted after the names were released. No more "House of Horrors" headlines. Instead: obituaries. Biographical profiles. Respectful remembrances researched by journalists who interviewed surviving family, pieced together fragments of lives cut short.

*Ruth Brennan, 18, crowned Eldon County Fair Queen July 1961. Wanted to be a teacher. Loved horses, literature, her twin sister Vera. Disappeared September 1961, family told she'd run away. Body discovered 2023 under fairgrounds barn, murdered by Eugene Crowley.*

Holly had read every profile. Memorized every name. These weren't abstractions anymore. They were women. Girls. People who'd had dreams, plans, futures stolen from them.

And today, Ruth was finally being buried properly.

---

The funeral service was small. Ashfield Lutheran Church, same building where Ruth's family had prayed for her safe return in 1961. Pastor Miller—too young to remember Ruth but willing to honor her—led the service.

Holly sat in the front pew between her grandmother Vera and her grandfather Robert. Vera held a photograph in her lap: Ruth at eighteen, wearing her fair queen sash, bright smile, whole life ahead of her.

The casket at the front of the church was closed. Not much remained after twenty-two years buried under a barn floor. But the funeral home had done their best—silk lining, flowers, dignity.

Pastor Miller spoke about lives interrupted, justice delayed, the importance of remembering. His words were careful, respectful. He'd consulted with Vera about what to say, how to acknowledge the horror without making it the only thing people remembered about Ruth.

Then Vera stood. Walked slowly to the pulpit. Set down the photograph so everyone could see.

"This is my sister Ruth," Vera said. Her voice was steady but strained. "My twin. We were born six minutes apart—she came first, always did everything first. Walked first, talked first, learned to read first. I followed. That was our pattern."

Holly watched her grandmother, seventy-nine years old, white-haired, standing in front of the congregation sharing memories she'd kept private for decades.

"Ruth wanted to be a teacher. Loved children, loved books, thought education was the most important gift you could give someone. She was smart—smarter than me, though I'd never admit it when we were young. Got straight A's, won scholarships, had college acceptance letters."

Vera's hands tightened on the pulpit. "She was crowned Fair Queen in July 1961. I was so proud. Thought it meant opportunities, recognition, doors opening. The Crowley family took interest. Eugene Crowley himself congratulated her, said there'd be a place for Ruth in their family's businesses after college."

A pause. Vera's voice cracked. "Ruth told me she didn't want anything from the Crowleys. Said Eugene made her uncomfortable, that Vernon—Eugene's son, around our age—had been following her, showing up places she went. She wanted to go to college far away. Get distance."

The church was silent.

"September 1961. Ruth vanished. We reported her missing. Sheriff said she'd probably run away—ungrateful girls did that sometimes, couldn't handle small-town life. We believed him because believing was easier than imagining..."

Vera stopped. Collected herself. "For twenty-two years, I thought my sister abandoned us. Left without goodbye because we weren't good enough, our life wasn't interesting enough. I was angry at her. Then I was sad. Then I just... forgot, most days. Moved on. Had a family, grew old, remembered Ruth occasionally with bitterness and grief mixed together."

She looked at the casket. "I was mourning wrong. All those years, I was angry at a murder victim for being murdered. And I'm so sorry, Ruth. I'm so sorry I didn't demand answers. I'm sorry I believed the lies. I'm sorry it took twenty-two years for someone brave enough to dig up the truth."

Holly felt tears on her cheeks. Around the church, people were crying quietly.

"My sister was beautiful, ambitious, kind. She deserved to teach children and ride horses and live a long, full life. She deserved better than being strangled at eighteen and buried under a barn by a man who thought he owned her because his family owned the fairgrounds."

Vera's voice went hard. "The Crowley family took my sister from me. From all of us. And I won't remember her as a scandal or a tragedy. I'll remember her as Ruth—smart, ambitious, alive. That's what they tried to erase. That's what I'm reclaiming today."

She stepped down from the pulpit, touched the casket gently, and returned to her seat. Holly took her hand. Vera's fingers were cold, trembling.

"You did good, Grandma," Holly whispered.

Vera nodded, unable to speak.

The pastor led a final prayer. They sang "Amazing Grace." Then the pallbearers—Robert, Holly's father, three cousins—carried Ruth's casket out to the hearse.

Ashfield Cemetery was two blocks away. The procession walked slowly through town. People stood on sidewalks, watching. Some removed hats. Others looked away, ashamed.

At the cemetery, seventeen new graves had been prepared. Families were burying their murdered daughters, sisters, mothers throughout October. Headstones in a row, each bearing a name that had been missing from this ground for decades.

Ruth's grave was ready. Fresh earth, October flowers, the new headstone gleaming.

They lowered the casket. Pastor Miller said final words. Vera placed the photograph—Ruth in her queen sash—on top of the casket before it descended.

"Goodbye, sister," Vera said quietly. "I'm glad you're home."

---

That evening, the town held a collective memorial at the fairgrounds.

Holly drove with her grandparents. The fairgrounds looked different now—excavation sites filled in, temporary white crosses installed where each woman had been buried. Seventeen crosses arranged in a line, each bearing a name painted in black.

*Mary Blackwell, 1884*
*Elizabeth Morton, 1891*
*Sarah Crawford, 1899*
*Margaret Anderson, 1906*
*Helen Porter, 1913*
*Dorothy Fisher, 1927*
*Rose Campbell, 1934*
*Alice Sherman, 1941*
*Lorraine Fisher, 1952*
*Ruth Brennan, 1961*
*Janet Morrison, 1967*
*Lisa Hendricks, 1975*
*Catherine Mills, 1979*
*Diane Foster, 1981*

Three more names from earlier decades, recently identified through forensic genealogy.

Hundreds of people had gathered. Not everyone—some still defended the Crowleys, or felt too ashamed to participate. But most of Ashfield was there. Standing in evening cold, silent, bearing witness.

Makeshift memorial: flowers piled at the base of each cross, photographs of victims propped carefully, candles flickering in the wind.

Holly walked along the line of crosses with Vera. At Ruth's cross, Vera knelt slowly, placed fresh flowers. Touched the painted name.

"I see you now," Vera whispered. "I believe you now. I'm sorry it took so long."

Jessie Carter stood at a small podium near the crosses. She'd been asked to speak—organizer of the investigation, voice of accountability, person who'd risked everything to expose the truth.

The crowd quieted when Jessie stepped up.

"Seventeen women," Jessie began. Her voice carried across the fairgrounds, clear and firm. "Seventeen names we should have known for decades. Seventeen lives that mattered, that were stolen, that we failed to protect or even acknowledge."

She gestured to the crosses. "These women were daughters, sisters, friends. They had dreams. Plans. Futures. They were murdered by men who believed family legacy and economic power made them entitled to control, abuse, and kill without consequence."

Silence. People listened.

"But the Crowley men didn't act alone. They were enabled by systems of silence—sheriffs who didn't investigate, editors who didn't report, families who accepted hush money, a community that chose comfort over truth. We're all complicit. Every person who heard whispers and looked away. Every official who dismissed missing girls as runaways. Every generation that prioritized Ashfield's reputation over seventeen women's lives."

Some people looked uncomfortable. Others nodded, accepting the accusation.

"We can't bring them back. Can't give them the lives they deserved. But we can do this—say their names. Honor their stories. Acknowledge our failures. And commit to never forgetting again."

Jessie pulled out a paper, hands steady. "I'm going to read seventeen names. When I do, I want you to think about who they were. Not victims. Not scandals. People."

She began.

"Mary Blackwell. Eighteen years old, 1884. Seamstress. Loved music."

A candle lit at Mary's cross.

"Elizabeth Morton. Nineteen years old, 1891. Teacher. Loved poetry."

Another candle.

"Sarah Crawford. Seventeen years old, 1899. Farm girl. Dreamed of traveling."

One by one, Jessie read the names. Families of the victims lit candles, seventeen flames against October darkness.

"Ruth Brennan. Eighteen years old, 1961. Wanted to be a teacher. Loved horses and literature."

Vera lit Ruth's candle, hands shaking. Holly stood beside her, watching the flame catch.

"Lisa Hendricks. Eighteen years old, 1975. Wanted to be a veterinarian. Loved animals, hated math, made terrible jokes."

Detective Sarah Hendricks—present for the memorial, in civilian clothes—lit her sister's candle. Her face was composed but her eyes were wet.

Jessie continued through all seventeen. When the last candle was lit, seventeen small flames flickered in the wind. Seventeen names spoken aloud, acknowledged, honored.

"They deserved better than this town gave them," Jessie said. "They deserved justice, protection, belief. We failed them. But we won't fail their memory. These crosses will remain until permanent markers are installed. Their names will be recorded in county records properly. Their stories will be taught to future generations. And Ashfield will never forget again."

She stepped down. For a long moment, no one moved. Then someone began clapping—slow, somber. Others joined. Not celebration. Acknowledgment. Agreement.

Holly watched the seventeen candles burn. Felt the weight of recognition settling over the crowd. This was what the singing had demanded—acknowledgment, belief, honoring.

The voices in her head had quieted since the memorial began. Not gone, but softer. Satisfied that their names were finally spoken, their existence finally recognized.

"Thank you," Holly whispered to them. "For trusting us to find you."

The wind carried the words away. The candles flickered but didn't go out.

Seventeen women. Seventeen names. Seventeen lives that mattered.

Finally, Ashfield was saying so.
