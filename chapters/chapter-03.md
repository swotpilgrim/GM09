# Chapter 3: Multiple Burials

By two in the afternoon, yellow police tape fluttered around four different excavation sites. The state forensics van sat parked near the main gate.

Jessie stood at the livestock barn, watching the team work—photographing, measuring, bagging evidence. The bones from this site lay on a tarp in approximate anatomical position. Even from a distance, she could see the skull.

Four sites. Four sets of remains. All female, Dr. Hess had confirmed. All buried at the same depth across the forty acres.

The fairgrounds had become a graveyard.

"Jessie."

She turned. Aaron approached carrying his ever-present clipboard and what looked like construction blueprints rolled under one arm.

"I need to show you something," he said. His expression was grim.

They walked to the exhibition hall, where someone had set up folding tables for the forensics team. Aaron spread the blueprints across one table, weighing the corners with his clipboard and camera.

"Construction records from the county office." He pointed to the first diagram. "Main stage, rebuilt 1979. Foundation excavation began July fifteenth, concrete poured August third. The bones we found were buried at four feet, right in the construction window."

Jessie looked at the blueprint. Vernon Crowley's signature sat at the bottom, authorizing the project.

"Livestock barn," Aaron continued, moving to the second diagram. "Rebuilt 1961 after the tornado. Foundation excavation ran May through June, structure completed by July for that year's fair. Same depth, same timeline."

Eugene Crowley's signature. Vernon's father.

"The grandstand." Third blueprint. "Renovated 1975, new foundation supports added. Work completed over three weeks in April."

Eugene Crowley again.

"And the exhibition hall." Fourth blueprint. "Major structural renovation 1979, same year as the stage. September through October, after that year's fair ended."

Vernon Crowley.

Jessie stared at the four blueprints laid out before her. Four construction projects spanning nearly thirty years. Four burials at identical depths. All authorized and overseen by the Crowley family—two generations of mayors, two generations of what? Murderers?

"The timing is exact," Aaron said quietly. "The remains were buried during active construction, before the concrete was poured or the structures completed. Someone with access to the sites, someone who could control the schedule, someone who knew exactly when and where to—"

"My father worked on the livestock barn." Jessie's voice went flat. "I remember him talking about it. The whole town came together after the tornado. They rebuilt it in six weeks. My dad was eighteen, just out of high school. He was so proud of that barn." She touched the 1961 blueprint, Eugene Crowley's signature bold and confident. "He showed me pictures of him and his friends, posing in front of it when it was done."

"Your father didn't know," Aaron said carefully. "None of the workers knew. This was done at night, or during off-hours when the sites were empty. Someone who could access the construction area without raising questions."

"The Crowleys controlled access. They always have. They funded the projects, oversaw the work, had keys to everything." Jessie felt something cold settling in her stomach. "Jesus. How long has this been happening? A hundred years?"

"I don't know. But these four are confirmed. And if the pattern holds—"

"There could be more."

"Yes."

The fairgrounds suddenly felt different to Jessie. This place where she'd shown her first 4-H calf at age ten, where she'd eaten cotton candy and ridden the Tilt-A-Whirl and watched fireworks with her parents every summer—this place had bodies buried in its foundations. People had died here. Been murdered and buried and forgotten, while the town celebrated above them year after year.

Movement caught her eye. An old pickup truck pulled into the fairgrounds, parking near the main gate despite the "CLOSED—NO ENTRY" sign Sheriff Pritchard had posted. She recognized the truck—Earl Brennan, Holly's grandfather.

"I need to—" Jessie started toward the truck.

Earl climbed out slowly, arthritis making his movements careful. He was seventy-six, weathered from decades of dairy farming, his hands permanently curved from milking. He stood at the gate, looking at the yellow police tape fluttering across the excavation sites, and his expression was something Jessie couldn't quite read. Not surprised, exactly. More like... confirmed.

"Mr. Brennan?" She approached carefully. "We're closed to visitors today. The sheriff—"

"I heard." Earl's voice was rough. "Tammy Sullivan called my wife. Said they found bodies. Four sites."

"Yes, sir. The forensics team is—"

"Just like the missing queen from '52," Earl said. It wasn't a question. It was a statement, heavy with old knowledge.

Jessie went still. "Sir?"

"Lorraine Fisher. Crowned queen in July of '52. Vanished that September. Everyone said she ran off to Chicago with some man, got too big for her britches." His eyes went distant, seeing something decades old. "My Vera was friends with her. They were both eighteen. Vera cried for weeks when Lorraine disappeared. Never believed she'd just leave like that."

"Mr. Brennan, if you know something about what happened—"

But Holly appeared then, running from where she'd been helping clean up the 4-H building. "Grandpa! What are you doing here?"

Earl seemed to come back to himself. He looked at his granddaughter, and something shuttered behind his eyes—a door closing, secrets locked away.

"Just checking on things. Your grandmother was worried about the fair." He put a weathered hand on Holly's shoulder. "Come on, honey. Let's get you home."

"But Grandpa, what did you say about 1952? Who's Lorraine—"

"Nothing. Old man rambling." He guided Holly gently but firmly toward the truck. "Jessie, you take care now."

Jessie watched them drive away, Earl's words echoing in her head. *Just like the missing queen from '52.*

Aaron had joined her at the gate. "What was that about?"

"I don't know. But I think we need to look into the fair queen records." She checked her watch. Almost four o'clock. "The library has the archives. Old newspapers, fair programs. If there's a pattern—"

"I'll meet you there at six," Aaron said. "I need to finish documenting these sites before the light goes."

"Okay." Jessie hesitated. "Aaron? If there are more bodies—if this goes back further—"

"Then we're looking at something much bigger than four murders." His expression was grim. "We're looking at a serial killer. Multiple killers, maybe. Generational."

The weight of it settled on Jessie's shoulders. Her town. Her community. The place her family had lived for three generations. How had no one noticed? How had no one questioned?

Or had they questioned, and been silenced?

By six o'clock, Jessie sat in a back booth at The Sunrise Cafe, waiting. The dinner rush was winding down—a few farmers at the counter nursing coffee, two families in booths finishing their meals. The cafe smelled like fried food and coffee and pie, familiar and comforting.

She'd ordered coffee but hadn't touched it. Her mind kept circling back to those blueprints, those signatures, that pattern.

Aaron arrived first, still carrying his briefcase and blueprints. He slid into the booth across from her, immediately pulling out his notebook.

"Forensics confirmed four distinct burial sites, all female, ages ranging from late teens to early twenties. They're requesting dental records from the state to try to identify the remains."

"Any estimate on how long they've been there?"

"Preliminary assessment matches the construction dates exactly. 1952, 1961, 1975, 1979." Aaron opened his notebook, showing her his neat engineering handwriting. "I also checked the county records for other major fairgrounds construction projects. There were significant renovations in 1947, 1942, and scattered projects in the thirties and twenties going back to the founding."

Jessie felt sick. "You think there might be—"

"I think we need to check every major construction project going back to 1883 when the fairgrounds first opened. Every foundation, every renovation, every excavation."

The bell chimed. Tammy Sullivan swept in, spotted them, and slid into the booth next to Jessie.

"Please tell me you've figured out what the hell is going on. I've had twenty-three phone calls today. Everyone wants to know if the fair's canceled." She pulled out a cigarette, then put it back. "Wayne showed up at my shop at three, drunk, ranting about dead people and cover-ups. Had to ask him to leave."

"Where is he now?" Jessie asked.

"Hell if I know. Home, maybe. Or at the VFW." Tammy flagged down the waitress and ordered coffee. "So? What did you find?"

Aaron explained the construction dates and the pattern.

"Four women buried during Crowley-overseen projects," Tammy said. "Jesus Christ."

"Maybe more," Aaron added.

"Earl Brennan mentioned a missing fair queen from 1952. Lorraine Fisher."

Tammy's eyes widened. "I know that name. My mother talked about her. Beautiful girl, won the crown, supposedly ran off to Chicago. Everyone said she was too pretty for her own good."

"1952 is one of the burial years," Aaron said.

They sat in silence.

The bell chimed again. Wayne Keller stumbled in, heading for their booth. Unshaven, bloodshot, smelling like bourbon.

"You telling them about the Crowleys?"

"Wayne, sit down. Keep your voice down."

"Why? Whole town's gonna know soon enough." He sat heavily. "State forensics. State police next. FBI. This is gonna be national news."

"Wayne, do you know something?" Aaron asked carefully.

Wayne's eyes focused with sudden intensity. "I know the Crowleys run this town. I know people don't ask questions. And I know—" He stopped, shaking his head. "I don't know anything."

"If you know something, you need to tell us," Tammy said. "People died."

"Yeah. Someone did." Wayne looked at each of them. "And that someone's probably still walking around. Going to church. Playing golf. While those women are in the ground."

He stood abruptly. "I need another drink." He left.

"He knows something," Aaron said.

"He's terrified," Jessie agreed.

Jessie looked at Aaron and Tammy. "We're in this now. We started asking questions, and we can't stop."

"You think it's dangerous?" Tammy asked.

"Powerful people don't like having their secrets exposed." Jessie thought about Wayne's fear, Earl's sudden silence, the sheriff's insistence on quiet. "Yeah. It might be dangerous."

"Well, shit." Tammy stirred her coffee. "Guess we better be careful. Because secrets have a way of coming out eventually."

"Then let's make sure they come out the right way," Aaron said. "With evidence. With proof."

Outside, the sun set over Ashfield, painting the sky orange and red. The town looked peaceful.

But Jessie knew better now. She knew what was buried beneath the surface.

And she was going to dig it all up.
