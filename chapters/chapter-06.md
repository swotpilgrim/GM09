# Chapter 6: Forensics Report

Aaron Webb's motel room had become a command center. The second bed was covered with documents—blueprints, records, timelines. The wall above had pages taped up in chronological order, red string connecting events.

Wednesday afternoon. Three days since the first bones.

Someone knocked. Aaron checked the peephole—Jessie, holding a paper bag that smelled like burgers.

"Brought lunch. Figured you hadn't eaten."

"Coffee this morning."

"Coffee's not food." She pulled out burgers and iced tea. "Eat."

They sat and ate in silence.

"The state forensics team finished this morning," Jessie said finally. "I saw them packing up. Any word on the official report?"

"Not to me directly. But I made some calls." Aaron pulled a folder from the pile on the bed. "My old CO from the Army has contacts in the Iowa State Police. He called in a favor, got me preliminary findings. Unofficial, but solid."

"And?"

"Seven bodies. All female, seventeen to twenty-two. Four strangled, two blunt force trauma, one undetermined."

Jessie set down her burger.

"Burial dates match construction—1947, 1952, 1961, 1967, 1975, 1979, 1981. The seventh, from 1967, was found this morning."

"1967 wasn't on Holly's list."

"Either she missed one, or this victim wasn't a queen. They're requesting dental records for identification."

Aaron spread out photographs—items found with the bodies. Fabric fragments, jewelry, personal effects.

"Each burial included personal items. Sashes confirming the queen connection. Jewelry. One had a class ring—1952 Ashfield High. Likely Lorraine Fisher."

"They kept their sashes. Like trophies."

"Bodies wrapped in canvas before burial. Positioned carefully. Someone took time. Someone who believed they had the right. The burials are ritualistic. Possessive."

"The Crowleys."

"The timeline supports it. Thomas Crowley founded the fair in 1883. Eugene Crowley was mayor from 1947 to 1979—all but one of these burials happened during his tenure. Vernon Crowley became mayor in 1979—the last two burials are his."

"What about before 1947?"

Aaron pulled out another chart. "I went through every construction record I could find for the fairgrounds. There were major renovation projects in 1942, 1938, 1931, 1924, and 1918. Before that, smaller projects scattered back to the founding. If the pattern holds—if the Crowleys were using construction as cover for burials the whole time—there could be more bodies we haven't found. A lot more."

The weight of it settled on them both.

"Forensics wants to do ground-penetrating radar of the entire fairgrounds," Aaron continued. "But that requires authorization from the town council, which means getting approval from—"

"Mayor Vernon Crowley," Jessie finished. "Who's not going to authorize anything that might find more bodies."

"Exactly. Sheriff Pritchard held a press conference this morning. Did you see it?"

Jessie shook her head.

Aaron played a recording. Sheriff Pritchard at a podium: "...tragic discovery of what appears to be historic burials. No evidence of recent criminal activity—"

"Historic burials?" Jessie's voice rose. "He's calling them that?"

"Archaeological issue, not murder investigation. Pioneer cemetery, not dump site."

The tape continued: "Fair postponed. Mayor Crowley has assured full cooperation."

Aaron turned it off. "Pritchard's playing it exactly how they want. Keep it quiet, frame it historical. Six months from now, they'll close the investigation, claim they couldn't identify remains. Life goes on."

"Not if we have something to say about it."

"Which is why we need more than a pattern. We need physical evidence linking the Crowleys directly to these deaths. We need testimony from someone who saw something. We need proof that would hold up in court, not just in the court of public opinion."

Jessie thought about Vera Brennan, who'd seen Eugene Crowley the morning after Lorraine disappeared, his clothes dirty and his truck coming from the fairgrounds' direction. That was something. But would an old woman's sixty-year-old memory be enough?

"What about the bodies themselves?" she asked. "DNA, forensic evidence—"

"They'll try. But these remains are decades old. DNA degradation, environmental factors—it's not like TV. They might get identifications through dental records, but proving who killed them? That's much harder without witnesses or contemporary evidence."

"So the Crowleys might actually get away with this."

"People have gotten away with worse for less." Aaron's voice was flat. "Small-town power structure, institutionalized control, decades of conditioning people not to ask questions. This is exactly how this kind of thing stays hidden for generations."

They sat in silence for a minute, the magnitude of what they were up against sinking in.

"There's something else," Aaron said. He pulled out a different document—budget records from the county clerk's office. "I've been looking into Crowley finances. The family owns or has significant stake in forty percent of Ashfield businesses. They own the bank outright—the only bank in town. They own the grain elevator, which means they control the primary market for every farm in the county. They own rental properties, commercial real estate, and half the farmland around Ashfield."

"Economic stranglehold."

"Exactly. And look at this." He pointed to a list of names. "Sheriff Pritchard's house—purchased from Crowley Properties 1975, below market value. County Coroner Dr. Hess—his medical practice got a major loan from Crowley Bank in 1968, below standard interest rate, still being repaid. The newspaper editor, the council members, the judge—they're all financially tied to the Crowleys in some way."

Jessie scanned the list. Her stomach sank when she saw her own family's name.

"Carter Farm Implement Loan, 1979, Crowley Bank. That's my father."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Mom's medical bills. Cancer treatment. We almost lost the farm." She stared at the document. "The Crowleys gave us favorable terms. Said it was because Mom had helped with the fair for so many years. Dad was so grateful."

"That's how it works. Bind people through debt and favors. Create a web of obligation. Anyone who speaks out risks everything—their business, their home, their livelihood. The Crowleys don't have to threaten people overtly. The financial dependence does it for them."

"We're dependent too," Jessie said quietly. "If I push this investigation, if I make noise, they could call in my father's loan. Destroy my family."

"I know."

"But you're asking me to do it anyway."

Aaron met her eyes. "I'm asking you to decide what's more important. Your family's financial security, or justice for seventeen dead women. Maybe more. That's not a fair choice, and I know it. But it's the choice you have to make."

Jessie stood up, walked to the window. Outside, Ashfield looked peaceful in the afternoon sun. Main Street with its grain elevator and church steeples. The courthouse where Crowleys had held power for a century. Her town. Her community. The place she'd lived her entire life.

Built on bones and lies.

"My mom used to coordinate the fair queen pageant," she said. "Before she got sick. She did the contestants' hair and makeup, helped them practice their walks, chose their dresses. She was so proud when they won. It was one of her favorite parts of the whole fair. She'd come home and tell me about each girl—their hopes, their dreams, where they wanted to go to college."

She turned to face Aaron.

"If she'd known what happened to those women—if she'd known the pageant was a hunting ground, that she was helping prepare them for slaughter—it would have destroyed her. She loved this town. She believed in it. She believed the Crowleys were good people because they funded scholarships and sponsored events and went to church every Sunday."

"Jessie—"

"I'm not saying I won't help. I'm saying this is going to hurt a lot of people I care about. Good people who didn't know. Who couldn't have known, because the Crowleys made damn sure no one knew. My dad still thinks Eugene Crowley saved our farm out of kindness." Her voice hardened. "But those women who died—they had families too. They had people who loved them, who spent decades wondering what happened, who died never knowing the truth. So yeah, we're going to do this. We're going to gather every piece of evidence we can find. And if it costs me my farm, my reputation, everything I have—at least those women will have their names back. At least people will know the truth."

Aaron nodded slowly. "Okay. Then here's what we do next."

He spread out a new chart—their investigation plan, mapped like a military operation.

"Tammy's gathering oral history through her salon network. Holly's researching historical records and compiling the complete list of missing queens. You're going to talk to the old-timers who might remember details. I'm continuing with construction and financial records. We meet every other day to share information and adjust strategy."

"What about Wayne?"

"Wayne's a wild card. He knows something he's not saying. Until he's ready to talk, we work around him."

Jessie studied the chart. It was methodical, organized, exactly what she'd expect from a former military engineer. It was also dangerous. Every line of inquiry would lead them closer to confrontation with the most powerful family in town.

"How long do we have?" she asked.

"Until the Crowleys decide we're a real threat. Could be days, could be weeks. We need to move fast and stay quiet."

Outside Aaron's motel room, a car engine started—someone leaving the lot. Jessie jumped slightly. Aaron noticed but didn't comment.

They were all getting paranoid. Maybe that was smart.

"I should get back," Jessie said. "Got livestock deliveries this afternoon. I'll start talking to people tomorrow."

"Be careful."

"You too."

She left with the forensics information burning in her mind. Seven bodies. Seven young women who'd been crowned and killed. Seven families who'd believed their daughters had just left for better opportunities elsewhere.

And the Crowleys, who'd orchestrated it all while the whole town celebrated their generosity and leadership.

Jessie drove back toward the fairgrounds, but she didn't go in. She couldn't. Not yet. Instead she parked on the shoulder of the highway, looking at the place from a distance.

The Ferris wheel. The exhibition halls. The livestock barns her father had helped build.

All of it tainted now. All of it a graveyard.

And somewhere beneath those structures, more bodies might still be waiting to be found.
