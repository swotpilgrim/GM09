# Chapter 9: Patterns in the Data

Aaron Webb's motel room looked like the headquarters of a conspiracy theorist. The wood-paneled walls were covered with paper—photocopied documents, photographs, timelines, maps. Red string connected data points in an increasingly complex web. One entire wall was dedicated to a master timeline spanning 1883 to 1983, with names, dates, and notations in Aaron's precise engineering script.

Friday evening. The group was meeting earlier than planned because Aaron had found something. Something bad.

Jessie arrived first, standing in the doorway with her mouth open. "Jesus, Aaron. This is—"

"Seventeen," Aaron said flatly. He stood in front of the timeline wall, marker in hand. "Seventeen fair queens with no traceable records after their coronation year. Seventeen women who disappeared completely from all documentation—no marriage records, no death certificates, no forwarding addresses, nothing. Gone."

Tammy came in behind Jessie, followed by Holly and Wayne. They crowded into the small motel room, staring at the wall.

The timeline was divided into sections, each marked with a name and mayoral tenure:

**THOMAS CROWLEY (1883-1919)**
- 1891: Sarah Mitchell
- 1898: Catherine Barnes
- 1907: Elizabeth Howe
- 1916: Margaret Sullivan

**EUGENE CROWLEY (1947-1979)**
- 1947: Barbara Yates
- 1952: Lorraine Fisher
- 1958: Patricia Klein
- 1961: Mary Petersen
- 1964: Susan Richards
- 1967: Unknown victim
- 1971: Donna Crawford
- 1975: Lisa Hendricks
- 1979: Jennifer Cole

**VERNON CROWLEY (1979-present)**
- 1979: Jennifer Cole (killed under Eugene, buried under Vernon)
- 1981: Karen Matthews
- 1983: ???

"Four under Thomas," Aaron said, tapping each name with the marker. "Nine under Eugene. Four under Vernon so far. The pattern started at the beginning—with the fair's founding. Thomas Crowley didn't just establish the pageant. He established a hunting ground."

Holly had gone pale. "How did you find all these names?"

"Census records cross-referenced with newspaper archives. Each woman was mentioned in the year she was crowned—sometimes with a photograph, sometimes just a name. After that? Nothing. They vanish from all records. No census listings, no marriage announcements, no obituaries. Seventeen women who ceased to exist."

"Jesus Christ," Jessie whispered.

Aaron moved to a second chart—a graph showing victim frequency over time. "The murders accelerated after World War II. Thomas averaged one victim every seven years. Eugene killed nine women in thirty-two years—one every three and a half years. And look at this."

He pointed to the most recent entries. "Vernon's frequency is increasing. Jennifer Cole in 1979—that was Eugene's kill but Vernon's burial, the power transitioning. Then Karen Matthews in 1981. Two years. The cooling-off period is shrinking."

"Which means what?" Wayne asked from the doorway. He hadn't come fully into the room, was leaning against the frame with his arms crossed.

"The compulsion is intensifying. Serial killers escalate over time—the reward diminishes, they need to kill more frequently." Aaron's voice was clinical, but his hands shook. "Vernon is accelerating toward something."

Tammy checked her notebook. "The centennial. The hundredth fair. That's what this is all building toward."

"Nine days," Holly said quietly. "The centennial pageant is in nine days."

The room fell silent.

"Will he do it again?" Jessie asked. "Will he choose someone at the centennial?"

"Statistically?" Aaron turned to face them. "Yes. This is a family tradition spanning a century. The centennial represents the culmination of that tradition. Thomas founded it, Eugene perpetuated it, Vernon will commemorate it. The psychological significance is enormous."

"So we have nine days to stop him," Tammy said.

"We have nine days to gather enough evidence to arrest the mayor for serial murder spanning decades." Aaron's laugh was bitter. "Evidence that will hold up in court against the Crowleys' connections."

"The bodies," Jessie said. "We have the bodies. That's physical evidence—"

"Of murder, yes. But not of who committed it. The remains are decades old. DNA degraded. We have circumstantial patterns—construction timeline, mayoral terms, missing women—but a defense lawyer will argue coincidence. We need something concrete."

"The barn," Wayne said suddenly. Everyone turned to look at him. His face had gone gray. "You need to search the barn."

"What barn?" Aaron asked.

"The Crowley barn. On the estate." Wayne's voice was rough. "If there's evidence, it'll be there."

"How do you know?" Jessie asked.

Wayne met her eyes. For a moment, Aaron thought he might actually tell them the truth, whatever terrible thing he'd been carrying. Then Wayne looked away.

"Just a guess. Old family property, lots of storage. Makes sense they'd keep things there."

It was obviously a lie, but no one called him on it. Not yet.

"I can search it," Jessie said. "I coordinate livestock transport—I have legitimate access. Vernon trusts me. I'll go tomorrow during the town council meeting."

"That's dangerous," Aaron warned.

"We need physical evidence? I'll find it." Jessie's jaw was set.

Holly had been quiet, staring at the timeline. Now she spoke, her voice small. "I'm in the pageant."

Everyone stared at her.

"What?" Jessie said.

"The centennial pageant. I qualified through 4-H. I've been in it for weeks—since before we found the bodies. I'm one of the contestants."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop.

"No," Jessie said immediately. "You withdraw. Right now. Call the organizers, tell them you're sick, you've changed your mind, whatever—"

"I can't," Holly interrupted. "Don't you see? If I suddenly withdraw after we've been investigating, after we know about the pattern—Vernon will notice. He'll know something's wrong. It'll tip him off that we're onto him."

"She's right," Aaron said quietly. "A sudden withdrawal from a contestant who's been committed for weeks would be suspicious. Especially now, when the fair's already dealing with the forensics situation."

"I don't care," Jessie snapped. "She's not going to be bait for a serial killer."

"I'm not bait. I'm cover." Holly's voice was steadier now, more determined. "As long as I'm just another contestant, just another teenage girl preparing for the pageant, I'm not a threat. I'm invisible. The moment I withdraw and Vernon starts wondering why—that's when it becomes dangerous."

Tammy had been doing calculations in her notebook. "There are five contestants total. Holly, Brenda Tucker, Amy Morrison, Sarah Klein, and Jennifer Barnes. Vernon's already been to two rehearsals. He's watching them."

"Watching them like prey," Aaron said.

"So what do we do?" Jessie demanded. "Let Holly walk around with a target on her back while we hope we find evidence before Vernon decides to kill again?"

"We protect her," Aaron said. "She's never alone. We make sure someone always knows where she is, who she's with. And we move fast. Jessie searches the barn tomorrow. If we find physical evidence, we go straight to state police. We don't wait, we don't plan, we just act."

"And if we don't find anything?" Wayne asked.

No one answered.

Outside, a car pulled into the motel lot, its headlights sweeping across the curtained window. Everyone tensed until the engine cut and they heard unfamiliar voices—other guests, nothing to do with them.

But the paranoia was setting in. The weight of what they knew, what they were trying to do.

Aaron looked at his timeline, at seventeen names spanning a hundred years. Seventeen women who'd been crowned and killed.

He'd spent his life building things—bridges, structures meant to last. This was different. This was trying to tear something down—a century of murder. He didn't know if five amateurs could bring down a family that had owned this town for generations.

"I'll be fine," Holly said quietly, though Aaron noticed her hands were shaking. "I'm more scared for the other girls. Brenda and Amy and the others—they don't know what they're walking into. At least I know to be careful."

"We need to warn them," Tammy said. "Without making it obvious. Maybe—"

"No," Aaron interrupted. "If word gets back to Vernon that someone's warning contestants—we lose any element of surprise. He might destroy evidence or—" He stopped, not wanting to say it in front of Holly.

"Or kill someone now," Wayne finished roughly. "Before you can stop him."

Aaron nodded.

"So we sacrifice those other girls' safety to catch Vernon?" Holly's voice rose. "We just let them walk around with targets on their backs while we keep secrets?"

"We protect all of you," Jessie said firmly. "Holly, you make sure you're never alone with Vernon. Never. Not for any reason. If he asks to talk to you privately, you say no. You stay in groups, you stay in public, you stay safe. And the moment—the moment—anything feels wrong, you call me. Day or night. I don't care if it's three in the morning. You call."

Holly nodded, tears in her eyes.

"I should go," Wayne said abruptly. "Getting late."

"Wayne," Aaron said. "Whatever you know about that barn—about what happened there—"

"I don't know anything." Wayne pushed away from the doorframe. "I'm just a drunk making guesses. Don't listen to me."

But as he left, Aaron saw the raw terror in his eyes. Wayne knew something. Something specific about that barn, about what they'd find there.

Something he'd been carrying for years.

After Wayne left, the four stood surrounded by evidence of a century of murder.

"Tomorrow," Jessie said. "I search the barn while Vernon's at the council meeting. If I find anything—sashes, jewelry, anything—I photograph it and get out. Then we go to state police."

"What if you don't find anything?" Tammy asked.

"I will. I have to."

They made plans—timing, communication, contingencies. Aaron gave Jessie a camera from his kit, showed her how to document evidence.

When everyone left, Aaron sat alone in his motel room, staring at the wall of names.

Seventeen women. Maybe more they hadn't found yet.

He thought about the fairgrounds, about foundations and excavations, about all the places bodies could be hidden under concrete and time.

He thought about Holly, seventeen years old and terrified but determined to do the right thing.

He thought about Vernon Crowley, who'd killed at least four women and was planning his centennial masterpiece.

Nine days.

They had nine days to end a hundred years of murder.

Aaron picked up his marker and added one more note to the timeline, in the space next to 1983:

**CENTENNIAL - COUNTDOWN BEGINS**

Then he sat down on the bed and tried to figure out how to stop a monster.

**[Word count: 1,718]**
