# Chapter 13: The Believer's Experience

Holly couldn't explain why she drove to the fairgrounds Monday night. Just a pull, drawing her toward where seventeen women had been buried.

Eleven p.m. She parked, killed the engine. The fairgrounds sat empty, dark, police tape marking excavation sites. Wind carried smells of churned earth and diesel.

Stupid to be here alone. Dangerous. But she grabbed her Sony cassette recorder and walked through the gate.

The midway looked wrong without lights and crowds. Rides silent, dark—Ferris wheel a skeleton against stars, game booths shuttered.

Holly walked toward the excavation sites.

Four pits where bodies had been found. Soon there would be more—state team returning with ground-penetrating radar.

She stood at the edge of the main stage excavation, where Lorraine Fisher had been buried in 1952. Where her grandmother's best friend had spent sixty-one years underground.

"I'm sorry," Holly whispered to the dark. "I'm sorry no one came for you sooner."

The wind shifted.

And she heard singing.

Female voices, multiple harmonies, rising and falling. Not loud—barely audible, like music from far away carried on the breeze. But clear. Distinct. Real.

*"We're from I-O-way, I-O-way, that's where the tall corn grows..."*

The Iowa Corn Song. The old pageant standard that queens had sung for generations.

Holly's skin prickled. She looked around—empty fairgrounds, no one but her. The singing continued, soft and sad.

Hands shaking, she raised the recorder, pressed record.

The singing swelled, as if the voices knew they were heard. Multiple women harmonizing, melody perfect, tone sorrowful. Seventeen voices maybe, or more.

Holly stood frozen, listening, tears running down her face. She didn't know why she was crying. Didn't know if she was terrified or awed or both.

The song ended. The wind died. Silence returned to the fairgrounds.

She pressed stop on the recorder, then immediately rewind and play.

Tape hiss. Wind noise. The sound of her own breathing.

But no singing. Nothing.

Holly played it again. Same result—wind, breathing, ambient noise, but no voices. She'd heard them clearly, had stood here recording while they sang, but the tape captured nothing.

She looked at the excavation sites, at the places where women had been buried and forgotten.

"I heard you," she said to the darkness. "I don't know what that means or what you want, but I heard you."

No response. Just wind through empty structures and the distant bark of a dog somewhere in town.

Holly walked back to her car, the recorder clutched tight, knowing she'd just experienced something that had no rational explanation. Something Aaron would dismiss and Jessie would call irrelevant.

But something that felt real.

---

The next morning, the group met at The Sunrise Cafe before driving to Des Moines. Holly brought the cassette recorder, set it on the table.

"I went to the fairgrounds last night," she said. "I heard them. The women. Singing."

Aaron looked up from his coffee. "Holly—"

"I recorded it. But it's not on the tape. I heard singing, clear as anything, and I recorded it, but when I played it back there was nothing." She pressed play. They listened to wind and breathing and empty fairgrounds.

"Auditory hallucination," Aaron said gently. "You've been under enormous stress, thinking constantly about these women. Your mind created—"

"I know what I heard."

"Grief can manifest in unusual ways," Aaron continued. "When my father died, I heard his voice for weeks. Called my name, gave me advice. It felt absolutely real. But it was my brain processing loss."

"This wasn't grief." Holly's voice was firm. "This was communication. They were singing to me. Warning me, or telling me something, I don't know what exactly, but it wasn't in my head."

Tammy had been quiet, studying the recorder. "What did it feel like? When you heard them?"

"Sad. They felt sad. Not angry or vengeful or scary. Just... sorrowful. Like they'd been waiting and finally someone was listening."

"Seventeen women buried in secret," Tammy said slowly. "Stories never told, names forgotten, blamed for their own murders. If spirits linger, those would have reasons."

"You can't seriously be entertaining this," Aaron said. "We're dealing with serial murder. Physical, factual, documented serial murder. Introducing supernatural elements undermines our credibility."

"I'm not saying it matters for the investigation," Tammy replied. "I'm saying maybe Holly experienced something real. Something we don't have explanations for."

Jessie had been listening quietly. Now she set down her coffee. "Here's what I think. Holly heard singing. Whether that was communication from dead women, grief-induced hallucination, or some weird acoustic phenomenon at the fairgrounds, it doesn't change what we have to do today. We drive to Des Moines, present evidence to state police, and stop Vernon Crowley from killing again. That's real. That's measurable. Everything else—" She gestured at the recorder. "—is for philosophers and priests. Not us."

"But if the dead are trying to warn us—" Holly started.

"Then we're already doing what they want," Jessie interrupted. "Getting them justice. Telling their stories. Stopping their murderer. Whether they're ghosts or memories or just the weight of injustice that won't stay buried, the answer is the same. We act."

Holly nodded reluctantly. Jessie was right. Practical, grounded, focused. But Holly couldn't shake the feeling that those voices meant something important.

Aaron checked his watch. "We should leave for Des Moines in an hour. Wayne's meeting us at the motel with his statement."

"What about the pageant rehearsal?" Tammy asked. "Holly, you're scheduled for this afternoon."

"Three o'clock. High school gymnasium." Holly had almost forgotten. Five days until the centennial pageant. Five days until Vernon Crowley chose his next victim. "I'll be back by then."

"We'll all be back," Jessie said. "This trip is just to file the report and hand over evidence. State police will handle the rest."

They drove to Des Moines in two cars. Aaron and Wayne, then Jessie, Tammy, and Holly. Three-hour drive in tense silence.

Aaron's contacts came through. By noon they were at State Police headquarters with Detective Lieutenant Sarah Chen and two investigators.

The photographs of the trophy trunk landed like bombs. Chen's expression went from skeptical to horrified as she flipped through images of seventeen sashes, jewelry, hair samples.

"Holy shit," she muttered. "How long has this been going on?"

"Since 1883," Aaron said. "Maybe longer. Three generations of the Crowley family."

Wayne gave his statement. Shaking, pale, fighting nausea, he described the night in 1975 when Eugene Crowley paid him fifty dollars to help bury Lisa Hendricks. Described the canvas-wrapped body, the grave, the conversation about family tradition and Crowley men not accepting refusal.

The interview lasted four hours. Statements, evidence documentation, chain of custody forms. Chen assured them the state would investigate immediately, coordinate with the FBI given the scope and duration.

"Vernon Crowley will be under surveillance within twenty-four hours," she said. "We'll move for arrest warrants as soon as we verify the physical evidence. This trunk—we need to locate and secure it."

"It's in his barn," Jessie said. "Locked room at the back. But he knows I was there. If he checks, sees the broken lock—"

"Then he'll destroy evidence," Chen finished. "We'll expedite. Tonight if possible."

They left Des Moines at four p.m., driving straight back to Ashfield. Holly made it to the high school gymnasium at five-thirty, an hour late, still wearing the same clothes from that morning.

Pageant rehearsal was in progress. Five girls on the makeshift stage—Holly, Brenda Tucker, Amy Morrison, Sarah Klein, Jennifer Barnes. Coach Martinez directing from folding chairs, demonstrating walks and waves.

And Mayor Vernon Crowley, sitting in the back row, watching.

Holly froze in the doorway. Vernon smiled at her, raised his hand in a small wave.

"Holly! Glad you could make it." Coach Martinez beckoned her over. "We're running through the introduction routine. Take your place next to Brenda."

Holly walked slowly to the stage, hyperaware of Vernon's eyes following her. She took her position next to Brenda—eighteen, blonde, beautiful, confident. The kind of girl who'd won every competition she'd ever entered.

The kind of girl Vernon Crowley chose.

They ran through the routine. Walk to center mark, turn, smile, wave. Holly went through the motions mechanically, but her attention was on Vernon. Watching how he watched the girls. The focus, the assessment, the possessive evaluation.

When rehearsal ended, Vernon approached the group. Shook hands with Coach Martinez, complimented the girls' progress.

"You ladies are going to make this centennial pageant something special," he said warmly. "Ashfield's hundredth fair deserves a queen worthy of that legacy."

His eyes landed on Brenda. "Brenda, could I speak with you a moment? About the scholarship program."

"Oh! Sure, Mayor Crowley." Brenda followed him to the side of the gym, eager and unsuspecting.

Holly watched Vernon's body language—the hand on Brenda's shoulder, the way he leaned in close, the proprietary stance. Exactly like the old photographs Tammy had found. The same pose Thomas and Eugene had used with their victims.

He was choosing. Right now, in front of everyone, Vernon Crowley was selecting his next victim.

Holly caught Jessie's eye—Jessie had slipped into the back of the gym to observe. Jessie saw it too. The recognition passed between them.

When Vernon left ten minutes later, Brenda returned to the group beaming. "He wants me to apply for the Crowley Educational Foundation scholarship! Full ride to University of Iowa!"

"That's great," Holly managed. Her stomach was churning.

After rehearsal, Holly found Jessie in the parking lot. "It's Brenda. He's going to choose Brenda."

"I know."

"What do we do?"

"We hope state police move fast enough." Jessie's face was grim. "Vernon doesn't know we have evidence yet. He thinks he's safe. But once he's arrested—"

"What if they're not fast enough? The pageant is five days away."

"Then we make sure Brenda is never alone with him. We protect all of you until this is over."

Holly thought about the singing at the fairgrounds. About seventeen voices harmonizing in the dark, sorrowful and waiting.

They'd waited sixty, seventy, eighty years for justice. They'd waited while more women died. While the Crowleys continued their tradition.

Now they were trying to warn the living. Trying to prevent another name from joining their chorus.

Holly hoped—prayed—that this time, someone would listen.

Before it was too late.
