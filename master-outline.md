## CHAPTER 1: SETUP DAY

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

September 1983, Ashfield, Iowa. Workers prepare the Eldon County Fairgrounds for the 100th anniversary harvest fair. Jessie Carter (livestock coordinator, local farmer's daughter) oversees setup. Aaron Webb (county safety inspector from Des Moines) arrives for liability review—meticulous, skeptical. Tammy Sullivan sets up her beauty booth gossiping. Wayne Keller (demolition derby organizer) is hungover and hostile. Holly Brennan (17, 4-H volunteer) decorates excitedly. Fairgrounds buzz: livestock pens cleaned, rides tested, bunting hung. Aaron notes structural anomalies in the stage area—settlement patterns suggest soil disturbance. Jessie dismisses his concerns. Chapter ends: construction foreman shouts they've hit something beneath the stage foundation.

**Tone:** Nostalgic Americana, establishing small-town rhythms

---

## CHAPTER 2: THE DISCOVERY

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Construction crew unearths human bones—old, buried deep. Sheriff Pritchard wants it quiet until after the fair. Jessie trusts the sheriff; Aaron insists on protocol. Wayne argues they can't cancel over "old bones." Tammy spreads the news. The coroner confirms: human remains, female, thirty-plus years buried. Aaron documents everything. A second worker finds more bones beneath the livestock barn—different location, similar depth. The sheriff's frustration grows. Jessie feels uneasy about the containment effort. Aaron measures burial depths, realizes they align with construction dates on fairgrounds blueprints he's reviewing.

**Tone:** Tension rising, authority trying to control narrative

---

## CHAPTER 3: MULTIPLE BURIALS

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Workers find bones at four locations—all beneath structures, spanning decades. State forensics called. Aaron cross-references: each site matches major construction (1952, 1961, 1975, 1979), all funded by Mayor Crowley. Tammy asks her network about missing girls from those years. Holly's grandfather Earl mentions "the missing queen from '52" then clams up. Wayne drinks, increasingly agitated. The group forms through shared unease: Jessie (leader), Aaron (investigator), Tammy (intelligence), Holly (innocent), Wayne (hostile witness). Forensics confirms: this is a burial ground.

**Tone:** Creeping horror as scope emerges

---

## CHAPTER 4: THE GROUP FORMS

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Fair setup continues in cleared areas. Jessie wants answers for her community. Aaron investigates patterns in the data. Tammy compiles decades of gossip about "girls who left town suddenly." Wayne wants everyone to shut up. Holly researches old fair programs, finds photographs of past queens. That evening they meet at The Sunrise Cafe. Aaron presents his construction timeline, Tammy shares rumors, Holly brings photographs. Wayne drinks spiked coffee, mocks their "Nancy Drew bullshit" but doesn't leave. They agree to investigate quietly. Each has motivation: Jessie's loyalty, Aaron's need for answers, Tammy's protective instinct, Holly's connection, Wayne's unnamed secret.

**Tone:** Uneasy alliance forming, stakes personal

---

## CHAPTER 5: THE MISSING QUEEN

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Holly questions her grandfather Earl about the 1952 queen. He reluctantly tells her: Lorraine Fisher, crowned July 1952, vanished September—official story was elopement to Chicago. No one heard from her again. Holly shares this. Tammy cross-references: almost every burial year has a "girl who left town" story. Aaron pulls county records—no death certificates, no trail. Jessie encounters resistance asking around town. They identify five names matching burial years. Holly photographs fair queens from archives—beautiful young women frozen in time. At night, walking past the fairgrounds, Holly hears faint singing—old-fashioned harmony from beneath the ground. Aaron dismisses it; Holly insists.

**Tone:** Pattern emerging, supernatural seeded

---

## CHAPTER 6: FORENSICS REPORT

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

State forensics: seven bodies recovered, all female aged 17-22, buried 1950s-1979, all homicides. Community reacts with shock. Mayor Crowley pledges cooperation publicly, privately pressures the sheriff. Jessie attends council meeting; mayor insists fair will proceed. Aaron analyzes the report—bodies buried with care, almost ritualistic. Tammy's network explodes with speculation. Wayne gets in a bar fight when someone suggests "old-timers knew something." The group reconvenes: seven bodies, seven missing women, thirty years. Aaron creates timeline. Jessie notices the Crowley family oversaw all fairgrounds construction. She doesn't want to believe it, but the pattern is undeniable.

**Tone:** Denial colliding with evidence

---

## CHAPTER 7: THE CROWLEY CONNECTION

**Act:** 1
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

The group investigates Crowley history quietly. Three generations of mayors: Thomas (founder), Eugene (1947-1979), Vernon (current). They've controlled Ashfield for a century. Tammy's gossip: Crowley men always "took an interest" in fair queens. Jessie finds property records—Crowley estate borders fairgrounds. Holly finds a 1961 article: that year's queen "accepted a position in Chicago, courtesy of Mayor Eugene Crowley." Aaron cross-references: every missing woman had Crowley contact before disappearing. Wayne becomes agitated at the Crowley name, storms out drunk. They realize the danger: Crowleys can bury this investigation too. Jessie decides they need physical evidence—she'll search the Crowley property.

**Tone:** Point of no return, committing despite danger

---

## CHAPTER 8: TAMMY'S NETWORK

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Tammy activates her full gossip network, compiling stories: "pretty girls who didn't know their place," "girls who got too big for their britches." The language reveals community complicity—disappearances framed as the women's fault. Tammy realizes she's repeated these stories without questioning. Pattern emerges: disappeared women "rejected" someone important. An elderly church lady remembers Eugene Crowley being "sweet on" the 1952 queen, "heartbroken when she left." Motive alongside opportunity: Crowley men chose queens; when rejected, eliminated them. Jessie struggles—she's known Vernon her whole life. Aaron focuses on evidence. Holly researches family-based serial killers. Wayne shows up late, drunk, hostile.

**Tone:** Information gathering, complicity revealed

---

## CHAPTER 9: PATTERNS IN THE DATA

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Aaron's comprehensive timeline: seventeen fair queens across a century have no traceable records. Seventeen. Thomas Crowley had four, Eugene had nine, Vernon has four. Murders accelerated post-WWII and recently (1979, 1981). Tammy asks: will Vernon choose another at this centennial? Holly realizes she's in the pageant. Jessie insists she withdraw; Holly refuses—sudden withdrawal might alert Vernon. They debate protection versus investigation. Aaron proposes they need proof before approaching state police (local sheriff compromised). Jessie volunteers to search the Crowley barn. Wayne mutters about "the barn," goes pale, leaves abruptly.

**Tone:** Stakes rising, danger immediate

---

## CHAPTER 10: THE CROWLEY ESTATE

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Jessie visits the Crowley estate pretending to coordinate livestock transport. Vernon is charming but proprietary—hand on her back, too close. He gives her barn keys, mentions he'll be at council meeting all afternoon. Alone, Jessie searches the massive barn. She finds a locked back room, forces it open. Inside: workshop, ropes, disturbing stains. A locked trunk beneath the bench. She breaks it open: seventeen fair queen sashes labeled with years and names, jewelry, hair, photographs. Trophies. She photographs everything with her camera, hands shaking. She hears Vernon returning early. She relocks the trunk, exits, composes herself. Vernon seems suspicious. Jessie leaves with evidence.

**Tone:** Discovery and dread, proof obtained

---

## CHAPTER 11: MAYOR CROWLEY'S CONTROL

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Group meets at Aaron's motel. Jessie shares trophy trunk photographs—undeniable proof of seventeen murders. Aaron wants state police immediately. Jessie wants to understand full scope first. Tammy investigates Sheriff Pritchard: funded by Crowley, owns Crowley-sold house below value. He's bought. They discuss other complicit parties: coroner, newspaper editor, clergy. Crowleys purchased systemic silence. Holly asks about Nancy Crowley (the mayor's wife). Tammy shares: passive, possibly abused, uninvolved. Vernon has no children—first wife died in childbirth 1951. Queens may be surrogates for the dead son. Psychological profile: entitlement, ownership, dynastic obsession.

**Tone:** Corruption's scope revealed, institutional failure

---

## CHAPTER 12: WAYNE'S SECRET

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Wayne is spiraling—drinking heavily, avoiding the group. Jessie and Tammy track him down, force him to talk. Wayne breaks: in 1975, age seventeen, Eugene Crowley paid him to help move "something heavy." It was a body—the 1975 queen, Lisa Hendricks. They buried her beneath grandstand foundations. Eugene threatened Wayne's family business if he talked. Wayne kept silent eight years, drinking to forget. He helped bury a woman. Jessie and Tammy are horrified but understand—Wayne was a coerced kid. Wayne provides details: strangulation in the barn, transport, Eugene's words ("Crowley men don't get told no"). His testimony is damning.

**Tone:** Confession, Wayne's redemption begins

---

## CHAPTER 13: THE BELIEVER'S EXPERIENCE

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Holly volunteers at fair setup despite concerns. At night she returns alone, drawn inexplicably. Near excavation sites she hears singing—multiple female voices, "The Iowa Corn Song." She records it on cassette; playback shows only wind. The singing is real to her. She feels presences—sorrowful, waiting. She tells the group. Aaron: auditory hallucinations. Tammy: unsettled but doesn't dismiss. Jessie: doesn't matter if real; what matters is justice. Holly believes the murdered women are communicating, warning about Vernon's intentions. Pageant rehearsals begin. Mayor Crowley attends, watches intently. Holly notices he focuses on Brenda (18, blonde, confident). Holly fears Brenda is next.

**Tone:** Supernatural ambiguity, current danger

---

## CHAPTER 14: FAMILY LEGACY

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Group researches full Crowley tree. Thomas founded Ashfield 1883 through questionable land acquisition, established fair 1884. His wife died 1890; he never remarried but had "associations" with young women. Eugene's wife died 1968 (officially heart failure; whispers: suicide). Vernon's first wife died in childbirth 1951 (stillborn son). Second wife Nancy married 1954, no children. Crowley men are dysfunctional, obsessed with legacy. Aaron's hypothesis: murders are about power—choosing the most beautiful girl, forcing submission or exacting punishment. Ritualized violence disguised as tradition. Jessie finds old photographs: Thomas, Eugene, Vernon with their respective queens—same possessive pose, hand on shoulder, ownership.

**Tone:** Dynastic evil, generational abuse pattern

---

## CHAPTER 15: MIDPOINT REVELATION

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Forensics update: seventeen bodies total, DNA matches to missing persons reports. Families notified—devastating grief. Media intensifies. Vernon continues public grief performance but changes behavior—more controlling, watching the group. Sheriff "advises" Jessie to stop asking questions. Aaron's boss reassigns him (pressured); Aaron refuses, takes vacation. Tammy's salon gets health violation (first ever). Wayne is questioned about 1975 involvement—someone tipped authorities. The group realizes they're targeted, pressure applied without overt violence. Vernon knows what they found, trying to silence them. They must act before he escalates.

**Tone:** Turning point, hunted

---

## CHAPTER 16: THE QUEENS WHO REFUSED

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Tammy compiles victim profiles: every murdered woman rejected a Crowley man—refused dates, broke relationships, declined "job opportunities." Posthumous language was victim-blaming: "uppity," "ungrateful." The town internalized Crowley narratives. Tammy writes an article humanizing victims. Editor refuses publication (Crowley pressure). Tammy photocopies, distributes at her salon, church, diner. Public opinion shifts—some question official narratives, others defend Crowleys. Town fractures. Jessie's father warns she's making enemies. Holly's grandmother Vera reveals: Vera's twin Ruth was the 1961 queen who "moved to Chicago." Ruth was murdered. Vera has lived with survivor's guilt twenty-two years.

**Tone:** Victims reclaimed, community reckoning

---

## CHAPTER 17: FINANCIAL CONTROL

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Aaron investigates Crowley finances: they own forty percent of Ashfield businesses, the bank, grain elevator, significant farmland, fairgrounds operational oversight. Economic stranglehold. Victims' families received anonymous "scholarships" or "loans"—hush money disguised as charity. Sheriff, coroner, editor, council members all received Crowley benefits. Systemic financial corruption. Jessie discovers her family received a Crowley loan in 1979 for her mother's medical bills—horrified at potential complicity. Vernon bought the town's silence through dependencies.

**Tone:** Economic corruption, overwhelming control

---

## CHAPTER 18: GOING OVER THEIR HEADS

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Group debates strategy. Local authorities compromised, media controlled, Vernon has economic leverage. Aaron proposes Iowa State Police, bypassing county. Jessie worries about repercussions. Tammy argues moral obligation. Holly insists they act before centennial pageant (ten days away). Wayne sides with action—his testimony is crucial. Aaron compiles case file: trophy photos, forensics, timeline, Wayne's statement, financial evidence. He contacts a state investigator from his military days, arranges meeting outside Ashfield. Plan: Jessie, Aaron, Wayne meet state police. Tammy stays maintaining intelligence. Holly continues pageant (sudden withdrawal alerts Vernon). Meeting set for three days out. That night: Aaron's tires slashed, note: "Leave town."

**Tone:** Escalation, overt threats

---

## CHAPTER 19: VERNON'S MOVE

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Vernon realizes investigation exceeds his control. He visits Jessie's farm with veiled threats about financial difficulties, destroying her father's legacy via "ungrateful children stirring trouble." Jessie stands firm but is shaken. Vernon visits Aaron with Sheriff Pritchard, threatens arrest for trespassing if he doesn't leave. Aaron records the conversation (hidden cassette). Vernon's mask slips—cold, autocratic: "Crowley family built Ashfield and won't be destroyed by outsiders." Aaron calls his contact, moves meeting to tomorrow. Vernon arranges emergency council meeting, proposes bulldozing excavation sites "for public safety," restoring land for centennial. Council approves overnight construction. Tammy learns this, alerts group: Vernon will destroy evidence tonight.

**Tone:** Villain revealed, desperate measures

---

## CHAPTER 20: THE BULLDOZERS

**Act:** 2
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Vernon sends out-of-county construction crew with bulldozers to fairgrounds at 10 PM for "emergency repairs"—level excavations, pour foundations by morning. Tammy calls Jessie. Group mobilizes to the fairgrounds, physically blocks bulldozers. Foreman threatens to call sheriff. Aaron calls state police; investigator says two hours away, hold the line. Townspeople arrive—some support the group (victims' families, people tired of Crowley control), others support Vernon (economically dependent). Community confrontation. Vernon arrives furious, orders crew to proceed. Jessie stands in front of the bulldozer: "Seventeen women lost everything. I won't let you bury them again." Crowd murmurs. Vernon loses composure, nearly orders removal when sirens approach: state police.

**Tone:** Confrontation, community choosing sides, climax building

---

## CHAPTER 21: STATE POLICE ARRIVAL

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Iowa State Police arrive with search warrants for Crowley estate and fairgrounds. Detective Sarah Hendricks (sister of 1975 victim Lisa—personal stake) takes control. She halts construction, declares fairgrounds an active crime scene, informs Vernon he's a suspect. Vernon shifts tactics: claims ignorance, blames deceased father Eugene. Hendricks executes barn search with Jessie guiding. Trophy trunk photographed, bagged, cataloged. Vernon's composure cracks—denial then arrogance. Confronted with 1979/1981 victims (his tenure), he becomes defensive, silent. Sheriff Pritchard sidelined. Tammy provides victim profiles. Wayne gives official statement about 1975. Holly shows excavation sites. Investigation becomes state-level. Vernon not arrested yet (procedure) but everyone knows. Vernon drives away, isolated, exposed.

**Tone:** Authority reasserted, villain's power crumbling

---

## CHAPTER 22: WAYNE'S CHOICE

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Wayne faces consequences for 1975 complicity—accessory, obstruction. Detective Hendricks questions him extensively. Wayne wavers. Group supports him: Jessie testifies he was a coerced minor, Tammy vouches character, Aaron emphasizes his cooperation broke the case. Hendricks offers a deal: full testimony against Crowleys for reduced charges. Wayne must publicly confess, face victim's family. Wayne agrees, breaks down during testimony—details Eugene strangling Lisa, transport, threats to Wayne's family. Damning evidence. But Wayne is tormented—can cooperation erase complicity? That night Wayne writes letters: apologizing to Sarah and Lisa's mother, thanking the group. He leaves them in his trailer. Next morning Wayne is gone—truck missing, trailer empty. Fled? Or silenced? Unknown.

**Tone:** Moral complexity, redemption incomplete, ambiguous fate

---

## CHAPTER 23: THE DARK MOMENT

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Investigation intensifies. State police excavate seventeen sites, begin DNA identification. Families grieve—some relieved, others destroyed. Centennial fair postponed indefinitely. Ashfield's economy craters—no tourism, national "House of Horrors" headlines. Town divides: some support justice, others blame the group for destroying reputation. Jessie's family faces threats; vendors cancel. Tammy's salon vandalized. Aaron receives death threats. Holly harassed at school. Vernon, lawyered up, maintains innocence—blames Eugene, claims he never knew. Physical evidence ties Vernon to 1979/1981 (belongings in possession, handwriting on labels), but he claims "preserving evidence" of father's crimes. Legal maneuvering threatens justice. Holly haunted by singing—sorrowful, insistent. Jessie questions if exposure was worth the cost. Aaron: truth is necessary. Dark moment: justice uncertain, community fractured, group exhausted.

**Tone:** Lowest point, truth's cost, uncertainty

---

## CHAPTER 24: THE CONFESSION

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Hendricks' investigation uncovers Vernon's diary hidden in the mansion. It details selection process, justifications, rituals. He wrote about "choosing the worthiest girl," believing it was his right as a Crowley. If she "accepted serving the family," gifts and position. If refused, "removed to protect legacy." He believed this was inherited tradition. Confronted with his writing, Vernon's legal strategy collapses. In interrogation he confesses fully—not with remorse but pride. He explains family tradition: Crowleys built Ashfield, the fair was theirs, the queen was theirs. Refusal was betrayal. Details each murder (1979: strangulation, 1981: blunt force), admits knowledge of father's killings. No empathy—calls victims "ungrateful," "necessary sacrifices for order." Extreme entitlement, delusional paternalism. Arrested, charged multiple first-degree murders. Remains convinced he did nothing wrong.

**Tone:** Villain exposed, psychology complete, justice beginning

---

## CHAPTER 25: EUGENE'S SHADOW

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Eugene Crowley in nursing home with dementia—unable to stand trial. Police interview him anyway; fragmented ramblings confirm participation. Talks about "teaching Vernon to handle difficult women," "the barn being useful," "keeping family strong." In lucid moments: no remorse, confusion about why questioned—believes he had the right. Investigators interview Nancy Crowley. She reveals life of fear: Vernon monitored, isolated, implied threats. She suspected something wrong but was terrified. Knew about barn, knew Vernon's night activities, knew girls went missing. Said nothing. Group debates her culpability—victim or accomplice? Tammy: abused and silenced. Aaron: inaction is complicity. Nancy provides no useful testimony, claims ignorance. Eugene dies two weeks after Vernon's arrest, never prosecuted. Vernon faces trial alone.

**Tone:** Generational evil, complicity across genders, incomplete justice

---

## CHAPTER 26: SEVENTEEN NAMES

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

DNA identifies all seventeen victims. State police releases names publicly: Lorraine Fisher (1952), Ruth Brennan (1961, Holly's great-aunt), Lisa Hendricks (1975), fourteen others spanning 1884-1981. Each story researched, shared. Media shifts from sensationalism to memorial. Families hold belated funerals—caskets, headstones, cemetery burials. Profound complicated grief: mourning delayed, mixed with relief and anger. Holly attends Ruth's funeral with grandmother Vera, who finally speaks about her twin—beautiful, ambitious, wanted to be teacher, crowned at eighteen, vanished two months later. Vera believed abandonment; now knows murder. Overwhelming guilt. Holly comforts her. Town holds collective memorial at fairgrounds—seventeen white crosses, seventeen names. Not everyone attends (some still defend Crowleys), but most do. Jessie speaks, honoring victims, condemning enabling systems.

**Tone:** Memorial, victims honored, healing begins

---

## CHAPTER 27: THE TRIAL

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Vernon's trial six months later (time compressed narratively). Prosecution presents overwhelming evidence: forensics, trophy trunk, diary, confession, Wayne's testimony (in absentia—never returned). Defense argues diminished capacity, family influence—raised believing this acceptable, brainwashed. Jury doesn't buy it. Witnesses: Tammy (community testimony), Jessie (trophy discovery), Aaron (structural evidence), Holly (victim family), Detective Hendricks (lead investigator). Vernon shows no remorse, insists he protected Ashfield's legacy. Nationally covered—"Iowa mayor dynasty of murder." Verdict: guilty all counts. Sentencing: life without parole, consecutive sentences. Vernon defiant, declares jury destroyed Ashfield. Led away. Crowley estate seized, assets liquidated for victim compensation. Family name erased from institutions. Ashfield separates identity from founding family. Group attends verdict together, exhausted, relieved. Justice served, incomplete as it is.

**Tone:** Justice served, closure incomplete, systemic change

---

## CHAPTER 28: WAYNE'S FATE

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Wayne remains missing. Truck found abandoned in Wyoming, keys in ignition, no struggle. Trailer cleaned out, no forwarding info. Theories: fled prosecution (plausible), started over (hopeful), or Crowley connections silenced him (darker, though Vernon was in custody). Hendricks investigates, finds no foul play evidence—Wayne vanished. Ex-wife reports he sent child support via untraceable money order—suggests he's alive, making amends. Group has mixed feelings. Jessie hopes he found peace. Tammy thinks he deserved redemption. Aaron believes fleeing was cowardice but understands. Holly prays he's safe. Wayne's disappearance becomes another ambiguous element: Friction Character who catalyzed investigation through confession but whose fate remains unknown. Running from justice, guilt, or danger? Redemption or escape? Unresolved—Wayne in liminal space like supernatural elements.

**Tone:** Ambiguous resolution, incomplete arc

---

## CHAPTER 29: THE FAIR'S FUTURE

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

Ashfield debates continuing the fair. Some say cancel—too tainted. Others say canceling lets Crowleys win. Heated meetings. Jessie advocates reclaiming, transforming from hunting ground to memorial. Aaron supports redesign—remove old stage, create memorial garden. Tammy proposes eliminating pageant ("no more queens judging girls"). Holly suggests volunteer tribute role—chosen by service not beauty, honoring victims. After months, compromise: fair returns, fundamentally changed. Beauty pageant abolished. Main stage demolished, replaced by memorial garden with seventeen benches, each bearing victim's name. Fair becomes educational—exhibits about crimes, violence prevention, accountability. Centennial postponed, rescheduled next year: "Reclaiming Our Heritage, Honoring the Lost." Revenue funds domestic violence shelter. Decision controversial but passes. Ashfield chooses to remember.

**Tone:** Community reckoning, transformation through memory

---

## CHAPTER 30: THE SINGING

**Act:** 3
**Word Count Target:** 1,700

September 1984, fair reopens. Lower attendance (painful associations) but community shows up. Memorial garden beautiful—native flowers, seventeen benches circling central fountain with engraved names. Holly serves as volunteer tribute (chosen for 4-H service, victim advocacy)—simple white dress, no crown or sash. She speaks at opening about remembering, preventing violence. Jessie coordinates livestock, grounding work. Aaron visits (returned to Des Moines, stays in touch). Tammy runs booth for shelter fundraising. Fair feels different—quieter, somber, hopeful. Healing is slow. That night after closing, Holly and Jessie walk the memorial garden. They hear it: singing. Multiple female voices harmonizing softly, "The Iowa Corn Song." Gentle, not mournful. Welcoming. Holly smiles. Jessie hears it too—acknowledges it. Voices seem to accept the memorial, blessing reclamation. Or wind through grass, wish fulfillment, imagination. Narrative doesn't say. Singing fades. Holly and Jessie leave, fairgrounds quiet beneath stars. Seventeen women remembered. Justice incomplete but present. Were they truly there? Book doesn't answer. Ambiguity remains.

**Tone:** Healing and ambiguity, supernatural unresolved, cautious hope
