# BIBLE: The County Fair

## STORY PREMISE

Early fall 1983, Eldon County, Iowa. The town of Ashfield is preparing for the 100th anniversary of its beloved harvest fair—a weeklong celebration of agricultural pride that defines the community. When workers excavating for a new stage discover human bones beneath the fairgrounds, the discovery threatens to destroy the town's identity. Jessie Carter, a local farmer's daughter coordinating livestock exhibits, joins forces with Aaron Webb, a meticulous safety inspector, Tammy Sullivan, a beautician with the town's gossip network at her fingertips, Wayne Keller, a volatile demolition derby organizer with secrets of his own, and Holly Brennan, a sweet-natured 4-H volunteer whose family history is darker than she knows. Together they uncover a century-long pattern of murders: the Crowley family—mayors for three generations—has been systematically killing fair queens who rejected their advances, burying bodies beneath the very stages where the victims once wore their crowns. As the investigation threatens the town's most powerful family, the group must navigate small-town loyalty, institutional corruption, and their own conflicting motivations to stop a legacy of violence before the centennial fair claims another victim.

## SETTING

**Location:** Ashfield, Iowa—population 3,200—and the Eldon County Fairgrounds on the town's western edge. The fairgrounds occupy forty acres of flat farmland: livestock barns dating to the 1920s, exhibition halls with peeling white paint, a midway with rusted carousel and Ferris wheel, grandstands overlooking the demolition derby pit, and the main stage where beauty queens are crowned each year. September brings the harvest fair: corn dogs and funnel cakes, 4-H kids showing prize hogs, tractor pulls, quilting competitions, and the Friday night pageant that crowns the Eldon County Fair Queen.

The town itself is classic Iowa agricultural: Main Street has a grain elevator, two churches (Lutheran and Methodist), Tammy's Beauty Barn, a diner called The Sunrise Cafe, and the courthouse where the Crowley family has held the mayor's office since 1883. Farmland stretches in every direction—cornfields being harvested, combines kicking up dust, the horizon flat and endless. The Crowley estate sits on two hundred acres north of town: a Victorian mansion with widow's walk, outbuildings including a massive red barn, and silos visible from the highway.

**Time Period:** September 1983. Ronald Reagan is president. The economy is recovering but farm foreclosures are starting. Technology includes rotary phones (party lines still exist in rural areas), CB radios, cassette tapes in truck decks. The fairgrounds use hand-painted signs, paper tickets, cash-only transactions. Investigation relies on physical records: newspaper morgue files, county archives, birth/death certificates stored in courthouse filing cabinets. No computers, no internet, no cell phones. Information travels through gossip at the beauty parlor, church socials, and the diner counter. Isolation means the nearest state police barracks is ninety minutes away, giving local authorities unchecked power.

**Atmosphere:** Golden September light over harvested fields, dust hanging in still air, the smell of livestock and fried food, cicadas droning. The fairgrounds feel timeless—fifty years unchanged. At night, the midway lights glow against dark fields, generators humming, and the fairgrounds become eerie when empty: wind through empty livestock pens, creaking Ferris wheel, shadows beneath bleachers where secrets are buried.

## CHARACTERS

### JESSIE CARTER

**NAME:** Jessica "Jessie" Carter
**AGE:** 26
**ROLE:** Protagonist/Leader/Local

**APPEARANCE:** Lean and practical, weathered from farm work. Dirty-blonde hair usually in a ponytail, sharp green eyes that don't miss details. Wears jeans, boots, flannel shirts with sleeves rolled up. Callused hands, sunburn on her neck, no-nonsense posture.

**BACKGROUND:** Born and raised in Ashfield, daughter of a corn and soybean farmer. Jessie took over livestock coordination for the fair five years ago when her mother got sick (cancer, died two years back). She knows every family in the county, helped birth half the prize cattle, and has deep loyalty to the community that raised her. Never left Iowa except for ag college in Ames. Came back to run the family farm with her father.

**PERSONALITY:** Straightforward, loyal, protective of her town but not blind to its flaws. She approaches problems like fixing a tractor: methodical, resourceful, stubborn. Doesn't trust outsiders easily (Aaron has to earn her respect), but once committed, she's all-in. Speaks in rural Iowa cadence—practical, direct, occasional farm metaphors. Uncomfortable with emotion but fierce when people she loves are threatened.

**ARC:** Starts believing the town is fundamentally good despite individual bad actors. Discovers the rot goes deeper—institutions she trusted (sheriff, mayor, community leaders) enabled decades of murder. Must choose between protecting Ashfield's reputation and exposing the truth. Learns loyalty means holding your community accountable, not covering for it.

**SKILLS:** Knows everyone and every property in the county (crucial for investigation), understands agricultural machinery and fair operations, physically capable (can handle confrontation), reads people through years of livestock negotiations and farm auctions.

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Respects Aaron's outsider perspective but clashes over his lack of connection to the community. Protective of Holly (reminds her of herself at that age). Frustrated by Wayne's drinking but knows his family, can't write him off. Bonds with Tammy over shared history—both small-town women who stayed when others left.

### AARON WEBB

**NAME:** Aaron Michael Webb
**AGE:** 31
**ROLE:** The Brain/The Skeptic

**APPEARANCE:** Lean, wiry build, dark brown hair kept neat, wire-rim glasses he adjusts when thinking. Clean-shaven, dresses like he's always on duty: khaki work pants, button-down shirts (sleeves rolled in heat), clipboard often in hand. Moves with careful precision—watches where he steps, notices structural details.

**BACKGROUND:** County safety inspector based out of Des Moines, covering fifteen rural counties. Former military (Army Corps of Engineers, served 1970-1974, post-Vietnam). Uses military discipline to manage anxiety—checklists, regulations, protocols keep chaos at bay. Divorced two years ago (no kids), lives alone in a Des Moines apartment, work is his life. Assigned to inspect fairgrounds for 100th anniversary liability review.

**PERSONALITY:** Obsessive about rules and documentation because regulations exist for reasons—usually written in blood. Skeptical of "small-town charm" because he's seen corners cut and safety ignored. Doesn't do small talk; asks direct questions and expects honest answers. Comes across as cold or robotic but it's anxiety management—structure keeps him functional. Needs evidence, data, documentation. Dismisses supernatural explanations reflexively but can't ignore patterns in the data.

**ARC:** Starts as purely procedural—bones are someone else's problem, he's here for building codes. Gets pulled in when he realizes the structural anomalies (settlement patterns, unauthorized modifications) align with burial sites. Learns to trust intuition when data is incomplete and to value Jessie's community knowledge as valid evidence. Final growth: breaks protocol to protect people rather than follow chain of command.

**SKILLS:** Engineering knowledge (structural analysis reveals hidden burial sites), documentation obsession (creates case timeline), access to county records through inspector credentials, persistence (won't drop an investigation once started).

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Clashes with Jessie initially (outsider vs. local, skeptic vs. loyal defender), but they develop mutual respect and subtle romantic tension. Frustrated by Wayne's recklessness and drinking (too much chaos). Patient with Holly (recognizes her earnestness). Finds Tammy's gossip unreliable until he realizes it's primary source intelligence.

### TAMMY SULLIVAN

**NAME:** Tammy Jo Sullivan
**AGE:** 34
**ROLE:** Information Network/Investigator

**APPEARANCE:** Curvy, bottle-blonde hair (teased high, AquaNet shellacked), heavy makeup (blue eyeshadow, frosted lipstick), long acrylic nails painted weekly. Dresses in bright colors—shoulder pads, tight jeans, ankle boots with heels. Looks like classic 80s Midwest: big hair, bigger personality. Chews gum constantly, smokes Misty 120s.

**BACKGROUND:** Grew up in Ashfield, class of '67. Married right out of high school to Mike Sullivan (mechanic), divorced after eight years (no kids, he drank). Went to cosmetology school in Cedar Rapids, came back and opened Tammy's Beauty Barn in 1976. Her salon is the information hub of Eldon County—women talk under the dryers, secrets spill during perms. Tammy knows who's cheating, who's broke, whose kid is in trouble. Running a booth at the fair (selling handmade ribbon barrettes and doing quick updos).

**PERSONALITY:** Gregarious, sharp-tongued, unfiltered. Talks fast, jumps topics, always has an opinion. Seems superficial (obsessed with hair, gossip, soap operas) but deeply strategic—she remembers every story, connects dots others miss. Loyal to women in town (protective of girls, suspicious of powerful men). Uses humor to deflect but harbors anger at how women are treated in Ashfield. Not formally educated but brilliant at reading social dynamics.

**ARC:** Starts treating the investigation like juicy gossip—thrilling scandal to discuss. Realizes the "girls who left town" were women she knew, women whose hair she did, women the town chose to forget. Shifts from entertainer to advocate—determined these victims get names and justice. Confronts her own complicity (she repeated the stories without questioning them).

**SKILLS:** Unparalleled gossip network (knows every rumor, can verify through beauty shop sources), memory for details and connections, access to women's spaces where men aren't present, social engineering (gets people talking).

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Bonded with Jessie since childhood (Jessie's mom was a regular client). Maternal toward Holly (does her hair for 4-H events). Exasperated by Wayne but knew his ex-wife (complicated sympathy). Finds Aaron uptight but enjoys teasing him until she realizes he actually listens to her intelligence.

### WAYNE KELLER

**NAME:** Wayne Douglas Keller
**AGE:** 38
**ROLE:** The Friction Character

**APPEARANCE:** Stocky, going to seed—barrel chest turning to gut, thick arms still strong from years of manual labor. Reddish-brown hair thinning on top, permanent sunburn, broken blood vessels on nose from drinking. Wears grease-stained jeans, motor oil-stained t-shirts (Harley-Davidson, John Deere logos), steel-toe boots. Smells like beer and cigarettes. Moves like someone expecting a fight.

**BACKGROUND:** Third-generation Ashfield, family used to own a farm equipment dealership (failed in '79 recession). Wayne never recovered financially or emotionally. Divorced (ex-wife took their daughter to Omaha), owes child support, owes money to half the town. Organizes the demolition derby every year—only thing he's good at, only time he feels in control. Drinks to blackout most nights. Has a mean streak when drunk but pathetic when sober.

**PERSONALITY:** Defensive, aggressive, fatalistic. Assumes everyone looks down on him (often right). Picks fights preemptively, especially with "outsiders" like Aaron or anyone who implies he's failed. Alternates between hostile and maudlin drunk. Self-aware enough to hate himself but not enough to change. Wants respect but sabotages every opportunity. Beneath the anger: guilt, shame, fear. He knows things he's never told.

**ARC:** Wayne helped dispose of a body in 1975 when he was seventeen—Mayor Crowley's father blackmailed him into silence (threatened his family's business). He's carried the guilt for eight years, drinking to forget. Investigation forces him to choose: protect himself or do the right thing. Confesses his role while drunk, crucial to breaking the case open. But before trial, Wayne vanishes—fled? Killed by Crowley connections? Or finally free? Unresolved.

**SKILLS:** Knows how to destroy things (demolition expertise), has dirt on people (kept quiet to avoid retaliation), physically intimidating (useful in confrontations), understands heavy machinery (relevant when Crowley tries to bulldoze evidence).

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Antagonizes Aaron (resents authority, resents sobriety, resents competence). Jessie pities him but won't enable him (she knew his ex-wife, knows he's got no one to blame but himself). Tammy gossips about him but remembers when he was a decent kid. Holly is scared of him. His isolation makes his confession more tragic—no support system, no redemption arc, just complicity and consequences.

**CONTRADICTORY VIRTUE:** Loyal to Ashfield in twisted way—his silence was meant to protect the town, even though it enabled murder. When he finally talks, it's because he can't let another girl die.

### HOLLY BRENNAN

**NAME:** Holly Anne Brennan
**AGE:** 17
**ROLE:** The Believer/The Heart

**APPEARANCE:** Petite, fresh-faced, strawberry-blonde hair in a practical braid, freckles across her nose. Looks younger than seventeen. Wears 4-H shirts (green clover logo), jeans, sneakers. Minimal makeup (her grandmother disapproves). Carries herself with careful politeness—small-town girl taught to be respectful, helpful, modest.

**BACKGROUND:** Junior at Ashfield High, straight-A student, plans to study veterinary science at Iowa State. Lives with her grandparents on a small dairy farm (her parents died in a car accident when she was nine—drunk driver, not their fault). Raised by her grandmother Vera and grandfather Earl Brennan. Active in 4-H for nine years: raises dairy cows, competes in showmanship, volunteers at the fair every year. Sees the fair as magical—childhood memories of cotton candy, winning ribbons, community pride.

**PERSONALITY:** Sweet, earnest, empathetic. Sees the best in people, believes in fairness and justice (naively, at first). Quiet but not passive—when she decides something matters, she's stubborn. Listens more than she speaks. Deeply connected to the town's history through her grandparents' stories. Open to intuition and "feelings" (hears the singing, senses something wrong before evidence appears). Processes trauma through caretaking—focuses on others to avoid her own grief.

**ARC:** Discovers her grandmother Vera was the 1961 Fair Queen who supposedly "moved away to Chicago." Actually, Vera's twin sister Ruth was the queen—Ruth was murdered by Mayor Vernon's father for rejecting his advances. Vera has lived with survivor's guilt for twenty-two years, never spoke of her sister. Holly's idealized vision of Ashfield shatters. Must reconcile her love for her community with the truth of what happened. Chooses to reclaim the fair as memorial, becomes volunteer queen the next year (no competition, just service)—honoring victims rather than perpetuating the tradition that killed them.

**SKILLS:** Knows fair history and traditions (oral history from grandparents), access to older generation's memories, emotional intelligence (gets people to open up), notices supernatural elements others dismiss (singing beneath the ground, cold spots, sense of presence).

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Looks up to Jessie (strong woman she wants to emulate). Finds Aaron safe (he's respectful, treats her like an equal). Loves Tammy (does her hair, talks to her like an adult). Terrified of Wayne but feels sorry for him. Closest to her grandfather Earl—his confession about "the missing queen" launches the investigation.

## VILLAIN

**NAME:** Vernon Eugene Crowley
**AGE:** 58
**ROLE:** Primary antagonist, third-generation killer

**APPEARANCE:** Tall, broad-shouldered, going to fat but still imposing. Silver hair carefully combed, clean-shaven, wears suits even in Iowa heat—three-piece with gold watch chain. Looks like a prosperous farmer-turned-politician: American flag pin on lapel, Rotary Club ring, handshake practiced for campaigns. But his eyes are cold—pale blue, assessing, entitled. Smiles with his mouth, not his eyes. Manicured hands that have never done farm labor.

**MANNERISMS:** Speaks in politician cadence—folksy phrases, "my friends," pats shoulders, remembers names to show dominance. Casual touches that assert ownership (hand on the small of a woman's back, steering people by the elbow). Laughs too loud at his own jokes. When threatened, the mask slips: clipped tone, threats delivered as friendly advice ("Wouldn't want anything to happen to your family farm, Jessie"). Habitually checks his watch (time is power). Carries keys to everything in town—literal and symbolic control.

**BACKGROUND:** Born 1925, raised in the Crowley mansion. His grandfather Thomas Crowley founded Ashfield in 1883, established the fair in 1884. His father Eugene was mayor from 1947-1979 (retired, still alive but senile in a nursing home). Vernon became mayor in 1979, expected to serve until death. Married twice: first wife died in childbirth (1951), second wife is Nancy Crowley, a passive woman who "doesn't involve herself in town business." No surviving children (stillborn son, 1951). The Crowley men choose fair queens as surrogates—if they comply, they're showered with gifts, jobs, protection. If they refuse, they're killed and buried.

**PSYCHOLOGY:** Entitlement calcified into worldview. Vernon genuinely believes Crowley men built this town and therefore own it—including the women. The fair queen tradition is his family's *right*: they choose the prettiest girl, she submits, or she's disposed of. He doesn't see it as murder; he sees it as maintaining order. "These girls owe us. We gave their families everything." Delusional paternalism mixed with sociopathy. Feels no guilt—only anger that he's being questioned. His father taught him: "Crowleys don't answer to anyone."

**METHODS:** Selection happens at the pageant. The chosen queen is approached privately—offered money, promises, threats. If she refuses, she's lured to the Crowley barn (isolated, soundproof). Killed by strangulation or blunt force (no guns—too loud, too traceable). Bodies transported in farm equipment, buried at night beneath fair structures during off-season construction. Sashes kept as trophies in a locked trunk in the barn. Uses power to control investigation: owns the sheriff (campaign donations, blackmail), owns the newspaper, owns enough of the county to threaten livelihoods.

**LAIR/DOMAIN:** The Crowley barn—massive red structure, hayloft, old horse stalls, workshop in the back. This is where victims were killed. The barn smells like old wood, motor oil, and something sour underneath. Trophy trunk hidden under tools: seventeen sashes, jewelry, locks of hair. Fairgrounds are also his domain—he has keys to every building, supervises all construction, decides what gets built and where (always over graves).

**WEAKNESS:** Arrogance. Believes he's untouchable, doesn't anticipate Aaron going over the sheriff's head to state police. Documentary evidence: kept trophies (can't resist), didn't destroy records (assumes no one would dare look). His father's dementia means Eugene might talk (doesn't). Vernon's need for control makes him react poorly to resistance—loses composure, makes mistakes, tries to bulldoze evidence in a panic instead of playing it cool.

## MYSTERY MECHANICS

**THE CRIME:**

Seventeen women murdered over 100 years—1884 (founding fair queen), then sporadic early years, accelerating post-WWII: 1947, 1952, 1961, 1967, 1975, 1979, 1981. All were Eldon County Fair Queens aged 17-22. Official stories: they left town for opportunities elsewhere, moved to Chicago/Omaha/Des Moines, lost touch. Families accepted this (economic pressure, small-town shame about troublemaking daughters). Authorities never investigated—Crowleys controlled the sheriff. Bodies buried beneath fair structures: stage foundations, beneath bleachers, under livestock barn floors. Discovered when construction crew excavates for new stage supports, hits 1979 burial (most recent, shallowest).

**CLUE STRUCTURE:**

**MAJOR CLUES:**
1. **Burial alignment with fair structures**: Aaron's engineering analysis shows bodies placed during off-season construction projects—only someone with authority over fairgrounds could coordinate this.
2. **Missing Fair Queens list**: Tammy and Holly compile newspaper archives—seventeen queens have no follow-up mentions, no wedding announcements, no obituaries elsewhere. All disappeared within months of their crowning.
3. **Trophy sashes in Crowley barn**: Jessie searches properties, finds locked trunk containing seventeen sashes matching the years of disappearances, plus jewelry and personal items.
4. **Wayne's confession**: In 1975, Vernon's father forced teenage Wayne to help transport and bury a body (threatened his family's business). Wayne describes the barn, the method, the location—corroborates physical evidence.

**RED HERRINGS:**
1. **Traveling carnival workers**: Midway rides operated by seasonal crew from out of state—easy suspects for drifter violence, but timeline doesn't match (carnival not present for all murders).
2. **Old indigenous burial ground theory**: Local legend claims fairgrounds built on sacred land, cursed. Aaron's research shows this is fabricated folklore from 1920s tourism promotion—no indigenous burials found.
3. **Deputy Carter's involvement**: Jessie's uncle was deputy sheriff in the 1970s, had access and opportunity. Seems guilty until Wayne reveals he was blackmailed into silence by Crowleys for witnessing something—he knew but didn't participate.

**THE AMBIGUOUS ELEMENT:**

Singing beneath the fairgrounds. Holly hears it first while volunteering late at night—old pageant songs from the 1950s-60s, faint harmonies coming from beneath the stage. Workers report hearing it during setup. Aaron detects nothing on recordings. The night before Crowley's arrest, Jessie and Holly both hear it clearly: voices singing "The Iowa Corn Song" (traditional fair pageant finale), multiple voices, welcoming. When the memorial garden is planted the following year, workers still hear it—now seeming peaceful, acknowledging. Is it grief-induced auditory hallucination? Collective guilt manifesting? Or are the murdered queens still present, waiting for justice, and now singing gratitude?

**RESOLUTION:**

State police forensics recover seventeen bodies, DNA matching missing persons reports. Vernon Crowley arrested, confesses under interrogation (arrogant enough to explain his "right"). His father Eugene too senile to stand trial. Trials scheduled but lengthy (legal maneuvering). Wayne vanishes before testimony—body never found, unclear if he fled or was silenced. Fair canceled that year. Town debates ending the tradition forever. Next year, compromise: fair returns with no pageant, just a memorial garden where the stage stood. Holly volunteers as "tribute queen" (no competition, just honor role). Opening night, workers hear the singing again—fainter, peaceful, like acceptance.

## TONE & VOICE

**Atmosphere:** Agricultural gothic—golden autumn light over flat farmland, beauty edged with isolation and dread. The fairgrounds feel timeless and eerie: creaking Ferris wheel in the wind, shadows beneath bleachers, the smell of livestock and fried dough turned sour by what's buried underneath. Nostalgic Americana (4-H ribbons, pie contests, demolition derbies) contaminated by violence. Small-town claustrophobia: everyone knows everyone, secrets are currency, leaving is betrayal. September heat lingering, dust on everything, cicadas droning—pastoral surface over rot.

**Dialogue style:** Rural Iowa working-class. Jessie and Wayne speak in agricultural metaphors and plainspoken directness. Tammy's speech is rapid-fire, colloquial, peppered with "you know" and "I'm just saying." Aaron speaks precisely, grammatically, a contrast to the locals. Holly is formal, deferential (raised by grandparents, taught manners). Vernon code-switches: folksy politician in public, cold command in private. Conversations over coffee at the diner, gossip at the beauty shop, arguments in pickup trucks parked on gravel roads.

**Pacing feel:** Methodical investigation with building dread. Starts slow—small-town setup, fair preparation rhythms—then accelerates as the pattern emerges. Chapters alternate between active clue-gathering and tense character confrontations. Not an action thriller; more procedural horror as the enormity of the crimes becomes clear. Moments of black humor (Tammy's commentary, Wayne's bitter jokes) relieve tension. Climax is confrontation and confession, not violence.

**Emotional tenor:** Grief and betrayal. The horror isn't graphic murder—it's institutional complicity. A town that chose not to see, families that accepted easy lies, authorities that enabled a dynasty of violence. Characters process collective guilt: how many people suspected but said nothing? Anger at corruption, sorrow for victims, disillusionment with the community they loved. Final emotion: cautious hope (memorial garden, reclaiming the fair to honor rather than forget).

**Reference points:** Tone of Grady Hendrix's *The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires* (domestic horror, women investigating male violence). Atmosphere of *The Last Picture Show* (small-town decline, nostalgia tinged with loss). Investigation structure like *True Detective* Season 1 (institutional corruption, rural gothic).

## THEMES

**Power and Exploitation:** The Crowley family's century of control—economic, political, sexual. How small-town power structures enable predators when everyone depends on the powerful family for livelihoods. The fair as metaphor: celebration of community built on hidden graves.

**Complicity and Silence:** Wayne's guilt for helping dispose of a body. The sheriff's willful blindness. Families accepting "she moved away" stories. Tammy repeating gossip without questioning. How ordinary people enable atrocities through passivity. The cost of breaking silence vs. the cost of keeping it.

**Women as Commodities:** Fair queens chosen for beauty, expected to submit or disappear. The crown as ownership ritual. Generational violence against women who refuse male authority. Holly reclaiming the role as service (not submission) disrupts the pattern.

**Memory and Justice:** A town that forgot its murdered daughters. The act of naming victims, acknowledging them, building a memorial. Can justice exist posthumously? Can a community reconcile with its past without destroying itself?

**Ambiguous Redemption:** Wayne vanishes—fled or killed? The town reopens the fair—healing or denial? The singing beneath the grass—haunting or blessing? No clean resolution, only choices to live with.
