## Chapter 1: Setup Day

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Jessie Carter, third person limited
**Setting:** Eldon County Fairgrounds, Ashfield, Iowa
**Time:** Early morning, Monday, September 12, 1983

* **Purpose:** Introduce main characters, establish small-town fair setting, and end with discovery of human bones beneath stage.

* **Beats:**
  1. Jessie arrives at fairgrounds at dawn, surveys setup progress—livestock pens, midway rides, exhibition halls. Feels pride and nostalgia for centennial anniversary.
  2. Aaron Webb arrives with clipboard and inspection gear, immediately notes structural issues with stage foundation. Jessie finds him uptight but professional.
  3. Meet other workers: Tammy setting up beauty booth (gossipy, friendly), Wayne prepping demolition derby pit (hungover, hostile when Aaron questions safety), Holly decorating with 4-H enthusiasm.
  4. Construction foreman calls Jessie over—excavator hit something hard beneath stage foundation. Workers gather. Foreman pulls up bucket: bones, clearly human, old.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Fair logistics and setup tasks, Aaron's safety concerns vs. Jessie's "it's always been fine" attitude, Tammy's gossip about townspeople, Wayne's defensive responses about derby pit, Holly's excited chatter about centennial history.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jessie begins with confident nostalgia and community pride. Ends with shock and unease as bones are discovered. Aaron's suspicions are confirmed—something's wrong here.

## Chapter 2: The Discovery

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Aaron Webb, third person limited
**Setting:** Eldon County Fairgrounds, excavation site
**Time:** Late morning, same day

* **Purpose:** Establish authority response (sheriff's cover-up attempt), reveal multiple burial sites, and show Aaron's methodical investigation approach.

* **Beats:**
  1. Sheriff Dale Pritchard arrives, examines bones casually, insists on keeping quiet until after fair. Aaron objects—this is a crime scene requiring protocol.
  2. County coroner confirms human remains, female, at least thirty years old. Wayne argues loudly they can't cancel fair. Tammy spreads news via phone.
  3. Second discovery: worker finds more bones beneath livestock barn foundation—different location, similar depth and age. Sheriff's frustration grows visible.
  4. Aaron photographs both sites, measures depths, cross-references with blueprints. Realizes burial depths align precisely with construction dates from 1952 and 1961 renovation projects.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Sheriff pressuring for containment ("tourism dollars"), Aaron citing proper procedure and state law, Jessie torn between trusting local authority and Aaron's logic, Wayne's angry pragmatism, Tammy asking pointed questions about who was buried.

* **Emotional Arc:** Aaron's professional detachment begins cracking—this isn't standard negligence, it's deliberate burial. His military training kicks in: document everything, trust the data.

* **Key Details:** Film camera and notebook for documentation, construction blueprints dated and signed by Mayor Crowley's office, coroner's preliminary examination tools, police tape going up, workers standing around uncertain.

## Chapter 3: Multiple Burials

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Jessie Carter, third person limited
**Setting:** Fairgrounds and The Sunrise Cafe
**Time:** Afternoon into evening, same day

* **Purpose:** Reveal scope of burials (four sites discovered), connect them to Crowley-funded construction projects, and begin forming the investigation group.

* **Beats:**
  1. By afternoon, workers find bones at four locations—beneath stage (1952), livestock barn (1961), grandstand (1975), exhibition hall (1979). State forensics team called.
  2. Aaron shows Jessie his blueprints: every burial aligns with major Crowley-funded construction. Her family helped build these—community projects she remembers. Discomfort grows.
  3. Holly's grandfather Earl visits fairgrounds, sees police tape, mutters "just like the missing queen from '52" then clams up when Holly questions him.
  4. Evening at The Sunrise Cafe: group informally gathers. State forensics confirms this is a burial ground. Wayne drinks heavily, increasingly agitated. Group realizes they're connected now.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Forensic team's preliminary findings, Aaron explaining construction timeline correlation, Tammy on phone gathering gossip about missing girls from those years, Earl's cryptic comment about 1952, Wayne's defensive anger, discussion of whether to investigate independently.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jessie's pride in her community begins eroding. If bodies were buried during projects her family worked on, did anyone know? Protective instinct wars with growing suspicion.

* **Key Details:** Four distinct excavation sites with police tape, blueprints with Crowley signatures and dates, Earl's weathered hands and distant eyes, Wayne's flask (bourbon), rotary phone at cafe counter, coffee in ceramic mugs.

---

## Chapter 4: The Group Forms

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Multiple perspectives, third person limited
**Setting:** The Sunrise Cafe, evening
**Time:** Evening, same day

* **Purpose:** Formalize the investigation group, establish each character's motivation, and set up their uneasy alliance dynamic.

* **Beats:**
  1. Group meets at The Sunrise Cafe's back booth. Jessie facilitates—she knows everyone, acts as bridge between outsider Aaron and locals.
  2. Aaron presents construction timeline and burial correlation. Tammy shares decades of beauty shop gossip about "girls who left town suddenly." Holly brings old fair programs with queen photographs.
  3. Wayne mocks their "Nancy Drew bullshit," drinks coffee spiked with whiskey, but doesn't leave. His agitation at the topic is noticeable—Jessie reads fear, not just anger.
  4. They agree to investigate quietly. Sheriff wants containment; they want truth. Each states motivation: Jessie (loyalty to community, need for answers), Aaron (patterns demand investigation), Tammy (protective of women), Holly (grandfather's comment haunts her), Wayne (unnamed, but he stays).

* **Dialogue Topics:** Debate over whether to trust sheriff or investigate independently, Aaron's data vs. Tammy's gossip (both prove valuable), Holly's research on past fair queens, Wayne's hostility masking something deeper, practical logistics of quiet investigation.

* **Emotional Arc:** Tentative alliance forms through shared unease. Jessie accepts leadership reluctantly. Aaron respects local knowledge. Tammy feels validated that her "gossip" matters. Holly commits despite fear. Wayne stays against his better judgment.

* **Key Details:** Back booth at cafe (wood paneling, vinyl seats), fair queen photographs (black and white, girls in sashes and crowns), Aaron's engineering notebook, Tammy's list of names from memory, Wayne's trembling hands.

## Chapter 5: The Missing Queen

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Holly Brennan, third person limited
**Setting:** Holly's grandparents' dairy farm
**Time:** Next morning, Tuesday

* **Purpose:** Establish personal connection to victims through Holly's family history and introduce supernatural element (the singing).

* **Beats:**
  1. Holly questions Grandfather Earl directly about 1952 queen. He reluctantly tells story: Lorraine Fisher, eighteen, crowned July 1952, vanished September. Official story was elopement to Chicago—no one heard from her again.
  2. Holly brings information to group. Tammy cross-references: almost every burial year has matching "girl who left town" story. Aaron pulls county records—no death certificates or forwarding addresses.
  3. They identify five names so far matching burial years. Holly photographs fair queen portraits at library archives—frozen young faces, beautiful, doomed.
  4. That night, Holly walks past closed fairgrounds alone. Hears faint singing—old-fashioned female harmony, "The Iowa Corn Song"—coming from beneath the ground. She's terrified but certain it's real.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Earl's reluctant memories of 1952 (neighbor's daughter, family searching, giving up), group cross-referencing burial years with disappearances, Tammy recalling stories about each woman, Holly describing the singing (Aaron dismisses as wind, Tammy is unsettled, Jessie stays practical).

* **Emotional Arc:** Holly's nostalgic view of fair history shatters as she realizes the pretty queens she admired were murdered. Fear mixes with determination—someone must speak for them. The singing feels like a summons.

* **Key Details:** Dairy farm (morning milking sounds, smell of hay), Earl's worn hands and sad eyes, library microfiche reader, black-and-white photographs of queens, empty fairgrounds at night (creaking Ferris wheel, shadows), cassette recorder Holly carries.

## Chapter 6: Forensics Report

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Aaron Webb, third person limited
**Setting:** Fairgrounds and town council meeting
**Time:** Wednesday, three days after discovery

* **Purpose:** Confirm seven bodies recovered, establish Mayor Crowley's public response and private pressure, and deepen the pattern connecting murders.

* **Beats:**
  1. State forensics releases findings: seven bodies, all female aged 17-22, buried 1950s-1979, all homicides (strangulation, blunt force trauma). Community reacts with shock.
  2. Mayor Vernon Crowley holds press conference—grief-stricken public face, pledges full cooperation. Aaron attends, observes Crowley's performance, notes practiced politician charm.
  3. Town council meeting: Crowley insists centennial fair will proceed in two weeks ("can't let tragedy destroy heritage"). Jessie attends, watches neighbors agree despite discomfort.
  4. Aaron analyzes forensic report alone: bodies buried with care, wrapped, positioned almost ritualistically. Not random disposal—deliberate, repeated pattern. Wayne gets in bar fight when someone suggests old-timers knew.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Forensic findings (technical details), Crowley's press conference platitudes, council debate about fair's future, Aaron questioning investigator about burial methods, Jessie reporting on council meeting pressure tactics, Tammy sharing speculation spreading through town.

* **Emotional Arc:** Aaron's investigation shifts from procedural to personal. The ritualistic care taken with bodies suggests organized killer(s) who believed they had right to do this. Pattern recognition intensifies—this isn't over.

* **Key Details:** Forensic report (typed carbon copies), press conference (reporters with notepads and cameras, no video), council chamber (wood paneling, American flag, portraits of past mayors—all Crowleys), Aaron's timeline expanding on hotel room wall.

## Chapter 7: The Crowley Connection

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Jessie Carter, third person limited
**Setting:** County records office and Jessie's truck
**Time:** Thursday afternoon

* **Purpose:** Establish Crowley family's century of control and their connection to every victim; end Act 1 with decision to search Crowley property.

* **Beats:**
  1. Group researches at county records: three generations of Crowley mayors spanning 100 years. Thomas (founder), Eugene (1947-1979), Vernon (current). They've controlled Ashfield's development entirely.
  2. Tammy digs through gossip: Crowley men always "took special interest" in fair queens—photographed together, gave gifts, offered jobs. Pattern of proprietary behavior.
  3. Aaron cross-references: every missing woman had documented Crowley contact shortly before disappearing. Jessie finds property records—Crowley estate borders fairgrounds, close enough for night transport.
  4. Wayne becomes visibly agitated when Crowley name comes up, shouts they're "messing with people who own this town," storms out drunk. Jessie decides they need physical evidence—she'll search Crowley property, has access as livestock coordinator.

* **Dialogue Topics:** County records research (dry data revealing control), Tammy's stories about Crowley men's behavior toward young women over decades, Aaron's statistical correlation, debate about danger of investigating town's most powerful family, Jessie volunteering despite risk.

* **Emotional Arc:** Jessie confronts painful truth—she's known Vernon her whole life, he funded her scholarships, and he might be a serial killer. Loyalty to victims must override loyalty to community image. Point of no return reached.

* **Key Details:** County records office (dusty filing cabinets, microfiche, clerk who knows Jessie), property maps showing Crowley estate layout, old photographs of Crowley men with queens (same possessive pose), Jessie's truck (pickup with farm equipment in bed).

## Chapter 8: Tammy's Network

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Tammy Sullivan, third person limited
**Setting:** Tammy's Beauty Barn
**Time:** Friday, morning through afternoon

* **Purpose:** Reveal community complicity through victim-blaming language and establish clear motive (queens rejected Crowley advances).

* **Beats:**
  1. Tammy activates full gossip network—calls every beautician, church lady, diner waitress in county. Takes notes while doing hair appointments, making calls between customers.
  2. Compiles stories about disappeared women: language reveals complicity—"didn't know their place," "too big for britches," "broke hearts when they left." Disappearances framed as women's fault.
  3. Pattern emerges: women described as having "rejected" someone important (names unspecified). Elderly Lutheran church lady remembers Eugene Crowley "sweet on" 1952 queen, "heartbroken when she left."
  4. Tammy realizes she's repeated these stories for years without questioning. Brings intelligence to group: motive alongside opportunity—Crowley men chose queens, eliminated those who refused them.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Phone conversations with sources (careful questions, listening more than asking), conversations with elderly women who remember "back then," discussing findings with group (Jessie struggles believing Vernon, Aaron focuses on evidence, Holly researches family-based killers, Wayne shows up late and drunk).

* **Emotional Arc:** Tammy confronts her own complicity—she spread these stories, accepted victim-blaming narratives, never questioned. Guilt transforms to determination. These women deserve their real stories told.

* **Key Details:** Beauty Barn (hair dryers, chemical smell of perms, vinyl chairs, rotary phone), Tammy's notebook filling with names and dates, photos of victims on salon wall, styling while talking, customers as information sources.

## Chapter 9: Patterns in the Data

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Aaron Webb, third person limited
**Setting:** Aaron's motel room
**Time:** Friday evening

* **Purpose:** Reveal full scope (seventeen victims over century) and establish current danger to Holly and other pageant contestants.

* **Beats:**
  1. Aaron creates comprehensive timeline on motel room wall: seventeen fair queens across 100 years have no traceable records. Not all murdered, but pattern undeniable—Thomas (4), Eugene (9), Vernon (4).
  2. Murders accelerated post-WWII. Most recent: 1979, 1981. It's escalating. Group realizes centennial pageant is in nine days—will Vernon choose another?
  3. Holly reveals she's a pageant contestant (qualified through 4-H). Jessie insists she withdraw; Holly refuses—sudden withdrawal alerts Vernon. Debate protection versus maintaining cover.
  4. Jessie volunteers to search Crowley barn for physical evidence. Wayne mutters something about "the barn," goes pale, leaves abruptly without explanation.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Aaron presenting statistical analysis, discussion of victim count and pattern acceleration, Tammy asking if Vernon will kill again at centennial, debate over Holly's safety (withdrawal vs. staying in to avoid suspicion), logistics of Jessie's barn search, Wayne's cryptic reaction to barn mention.

* **Emotional Arc:** Abstract investigation becomes immediate danger. Holly is potential victim. Group must balance gathering evidence with protecting her. Aaron's analytical approach cracks—these are lives, not data points.

* **Key Details:** Motel room (wood paneling, twin beds, timeline covering entire wall with photos and notes), red string connecting data points, calculator and engineering notebook, group crowded into small room, Wayne's visible terror at barn mention.

## Chapter 10: The Crowley Estate

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Jessie Carter, third person limited
**Setting:** Crowley estate and barn
**Time:** Saturday afternoon

* **Purpose:** Discover physical evidence (trophy trunk with seventeen sashes) that proves murders and Crowley guilt.

* **Beats:**
  1. Jessie visits estate under pretense of coordinating livestock transport. Vernon greets her warmly but proprietarily—hand on her back, standing too close. She deflects to business. He gives her barn keys, mentions council meeting all afternoon.
  2. Alone in massive barn, Jessie searches methodically. Finds normal equipment until locked room at back. Forces lock with tools—inside: workshop, coiled ropes, disturbing dark stains on concrete.
  3. Locked trunk beneath workbench. She breaks it open: seventeen fair queen sashes labeled with years and names, jewelry, locks of hair, photographs. Trophies. She photographs everything with trembling hands.
  4. Hears vehicle approaching—Vernon returning early. She relocks trunk hastily, exits barn, composes herself. Vernon seems suspicious but can't prove anything. Jessie leaves with evidence documented.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Vernon's proprietary small talk about town business and fair preparations, Jessie's careful deflection and business-focused responses, her internal monologue while searching (fear, determination), brief tense exchange when Vernon returns (his suspicion, her practiced calm).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jessie begins confident but becomes increasingly horrified as she finds evidence. The trophy trunk confirmation is visceral—seventeen women reduced to keepsakes. Fear when Vernon returns nearly undoes her, but anger steadies her hand.

* **Key Details:** Victorian mansion (imposing, well-maintained), massive red barn (horse stalls, hayloft, workshop smell of oil and wood), locked trunk (old-fashioned, heavy), sashes (silk, faded, labeled in careful handwriting), Kodak 110 camera, Jessie's trembling hands.

## Chapter 11: Mayor Crowley's Control

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Multiple perspectives, third person limited
**Setting:** Aaron's motel room
**Time:** Saturday evening

* **Purpose:** Confirm undeniable proof of seventeen murders and reveal systemic corruption enabling Crowley family.

* **Beats:**
  1. Group meets at Aaron's motel. Jessie shares photographs of trophy trunk—seventeen sashes matching missing queens exactly. Undeniable proof. Room goes silent processing this.
  2. Aaron insists on contacting state police immediately, bypassing local sheriff. Jessie agrees but wants to understand full scope—who else knew?
  3. Tammy investigates Sheriff Pritchard: twelve years in office, funded by Crowley donations, owns house sold by Crowleys below market value. He's bought. Discussion of other complicit parties.
  4. Holly asks about Nancy Crowley (mayor's wife). Tammy shares: passive, possibly abused, uninvolved. Vernon's first wife died in childbirth 1951. Queens may be surrogates for dead son. Psychological profile emerging.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Group's shock processing trophy evidence, Aaron explaining proper chain of custody for state police, Tammy's research on sheriff's financial ties to Crowleys, discussion of who knew (coroner, editor, clergy), speculation about Vernon's psychology, debate about Nancy's complicity.

* **Emotional Arc:** Horror gives way to determination. They have proof. Now they must ensure it reaches authorities who aren't compromised. Jessie accepts they're fighting the entire power structure, not just one man.

* **Key Details:** Photographs spread on motel bed (sashes, jewelry, names visible), notes on corruption network, coffee from motel pot (bitter, endless cups), Aaron's military contacts list, sense of conspiracy's scope.

## Chapter 12: Wayne's Secret

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Wayne Keller, third person limited
**Setting:** Wayne's trailer
**Time:** Sunday morning

* **Purpose:** Reveal Wayne's complicity in 1975 murder through coerced confession, providing eyewitness testimony and deepening understanding of Crowley methods.

* **Beats:**
  1. Wayne has been spiraling—drinking heavily, avoiding group. Jessie and Tammy track him to his trailer, find him blackout drunk. They sober him up with coffee, force him to talk.
  2. Wayne breaks down: 1975, age seventeen, working summer construction. Eugene Crowley approached with "special job"—move something heavy, fifty dollars cash. Desperate for money (family business failing), Wayne agreed.
  3. The "something" was a body wrapped in canvas—young woman, 1975 fair queen Lisa Hendricks. Wayne and Eugene buried her beneath grandstand foundation during night construction.
  4. Eugene told Wayne if he spoke, family business destroyed and Wayne charged as accomplice. Wayne kept silent eight years. Guilt drove him to drinking. Details: strangulation in barn, Eugene's words ("Crowley men don't get told no").

* **Dialogue Topics:** Jessie and Tammy's intervention (concerned but firm), Wayne's initial denial then breakdown, detailed confession about that night (what he saw, what Eugene said, where they buried her), Wayne's guilt and self-loathing, group's response (horror but understanding—he was a coerced kid).

* **Emotional Arc:** Wayne's eight-year secret tears him apart. Confession brings no relief, only shame. He helped bury a woman and did nothing. Jessie and Tammy's understanding doesn't absolve him, but their belief in his coercion versus Eugene's power offers small mercy.

* **Key Details:** Trailer (small, cluttered, empty liquor bottles), Wayne's physical deterioration (shaking hands, bloodshot eyes), coffee pot working overtime, Wayne's work boots from 1975 (kept, can't throw away), detailed memory of that night (too vivid to be forgotten).

## Chapter 13: The Believer's Experience

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Holly Brennan, third person limited
**Setting:** Fairgrounds at night and pageant rehearsal
**Time:** Monday evening and Tuesday

* **Purpose:** Deepen supernatural ambiguity with Holly's experiences and establish current danger to pageant contestants.

* **Beats:**
  1. Holly returns to fairgrounds alone at night, drawn inexplicably. Near excavation sites, hears singing clearly—multiple female voices, "The Iowa Corn Song," old pageant harmony. Records on cassette; playback shows only wind.
  2. She feels presences—not malevolent but sorrowful, waiting. Tells group: Aaron dismisses (grief-induced hallucination), Tammy unsettled but doesn't reject, Jessie stays practical (doesn't matter if real, justice matters).
  3. Pageant rehearsals begin. Five contestants including Holly. Mayor Crowley attends, watches intently, makes small talk with girls. Holly notices he pays particular attention to Brenda (18, blonde, confident).
  4. Holly believes murdered women are communicating, perhaps warning about Vernon's intentions. She fears Brenda might be next if they don't act soon.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Holly describing singing to skeptical group, Aaron's scientific explanations vs. Holly's certainty, pageant small talk (nervous girls, Vernon's charm), Holly confiding fear about Brenda to Jessie, discussion of protection plan for contestants.

* **Emotional Arc:** Holly's innocent view of spiritual communication conflicts with investigation's dark reality. The singing feels like responsibility—these women chose her to hear them. Fear for Brenda and herself intensifies determination.

* **Key Details:** Fairgrounds at night (empty, eerie, wind through structures), cassette recorder (Sony, tape hiss, no singing on playback), pageant rehearsal (high school gymnasium, folding chairs, girls in casual clothes practicing walks), Vernon's watchful eyes, Holly's growing dread.

## Chapter 14: Family Legacy

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Aaron Webb, third person limited
**Setting:** County records office and library
**Time:** Wednesday

* **Purpose:** Establish full Crowley family dysfunction and psychological pattern across three generations.

* **Beats:**
  1. Group researches complete Crowley family tree. Thomas founded Ashfield 1883 through questionable land acquisition (indigenous displacement, legal manipulation), established fair 1884. Wife died 1890, never remarried, "associations" with young women.
  2. Eugene married 1946, known for affairs. Wife (Vernon's mother) reclusive, died 1968—officially heart failure, whispers of suicide. Pattern of dysfunctional relationships.
  3. Vernon married 1950; wife died childbirth 1951 (stillborn son). Second wife Nancy 1954, no children. Crowley men obsessed with legacy, unable to maintain healthy relationships.
  4. Aaron hypothesizes: murders about power and possession—choosing most beautiful, accomplished girl, forcing submission or exacting punishment. Ritualized violence disguised as civic tradition. Old photographs confirm possessive poses with queens.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Research findings shared among group, Aaron's psychological profiling, Jessie's memories of Vernon (always controlled, always watching), Tammy's gossip about Crowley family dysfunction over decades, discussion of why Nancy stayed (fear, isolation, complicity).

* **Emotional Arc:** Aaron pieces together generational pattern—this wasn't one man's madness but inherited entitlement. The horror deepens: three men, a century, seventeen lives. Systematic, traditional, believed to be their right.

* **Key Details:** Family tree diagram Aaron creates, death certificates (suspicious causes), marriage records, old photographs (Thomas, Eugene, Vernon each with their queens—same possessive hand on shoulder), pattern of dead wives and murdered surrogates.

---

## Chapter 15: Midpoint Revelation

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Jessie Carter, third person limited
**Setting:** Various locations around Ashfield
**Time:** Thursday and Friday

* **Purpose:** Midpoint turn—investigation is discovered, group becomes targets, pressure escalates, forcing action.

* **Beats:**
  1. Forensics update public: seventeen bodies total, DNA matches to missing persons. Families notified, devastating grief. Media intensifies—regional news coverage, reporters descending on Ashfield.
  2. Mayor Crowley continues public grief performance but behavior shifts. Sheriff "advises" Jessie to stop asking questions "for her own good." Aaron's boss reassigns him (Crowley pressure); Aaron refuses, takes vacation time.
  3. Tammy's salon receives first-ever health code violation. Wayne questioned by sheriff about 1975 involvement—someone tipped authorities (Vernon, discrediting witness).
  4. Group realizes they're targeted—pressure applied without overt violence (too much attention). Vernon knows what they found, trying to silence them quietly. Theory shifts: they're being hunted. Must act before he escalates.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Forensic update details, families' grief reactions, Crowley's press statements, Sheriff Pritchard's thinly veiled threats to Jessie, Aaron's boss ordering him away, Tammy's anger at violation notice, group's strategy meeting (going to state police vs. gathering more evidence).

* **Emotional Arc:** Jessie realizes they crossed threshold—Vernon knows they're investigating, and he's mobilizing power structure against them. Fear mixes with anger. Can't back down now. Hunter becomes hunted. Midpoint reversal complete.

* **Key Details:** DNA report (official state letterhead), news vans (regional stations, reporters with notepads), sheriff's patrol car parked outside Jessie's farm (intimidation), health inspector at Tammy's salon (manufactured violation), sense of being watched.

**END PART 1**
**Word Count: ~3,975 words (Chapters 1-15, averaging ~265 words/chapter)**
